<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We must get rid of that
Christ, we must get rid of that Christ!&rdquo; So spake one of the
wisest, one of the most lovable of men, Ralph Waldo Emerson. &ldquo;If
I had my way,&rdquo; said Thomas Carlyle, &ldquo;the world would hear a
pretty stern command&mdash;Exit Christ.&rdquo; Since Emerson and
Carlyle spoke a revolution has taken place in the thoughts of men. The
more enlightened of them are now rid of Christ. From their minds he has
made his exit. To quote the words of Prof. Goldwin Smith, &ldquo;The
mighty and supreme Jesus, who was to transfigure all humanity by his
divine wit and grace&mdash;this Jesus has flown.&rdquo; The
supernatural Christ of the New Testament, the god of orthodox
Christianity, is dead. But priestcraft lives and conjures up the ghost
of this dead god to frighten and enslave the masses of mankind. The
name of Christ has caused more persecutions, wars, and miseries than
any other name has caused. The darkest wrongs are still inspired by it.
The wails of anguish that went up from Kishenev, Odessa, and Bialystok
still vibrate in our ears.</p>
<p>Two notable works controverting the divinity of Christ appeared in
the last century, the <i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i> of Strauss, and the
<i lang="fr">Vie de Jesus</i> of Renan. Strauss <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>in his work,
one of the masterpieces of Freethought literature, endeavors to prove,
and proves to the satisfaction of a majority of his readers, that Jesus
Christ is a historical myth. This work possesses permanent value, but
it was written for the scholar and not for the general reader. In the
German and Latin versions, and in the admirable English translation of
Marian Evans (George Eliot), the citations from the Gospels&mdash;and
they are many&mdash;are in Greek.</p>
<p>Renan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Jesus,&rdquo; written in Palestine, has
had, especially in its abridged form, an immense circulation, and has
been a potent factor in the dethronement of Christ. It is a charming
book and displays great learning. But it is a romance, not a biography.
The Jesus of Renan, like the Satan of Milton, while suggested by the
Bible, is a modern creation. The warp is to be found in the Four
Gospels, but the woof was spun in the brain of the brilliant Frenchman.
Of this book Renan&rsquo;s fellow-countryman, Dr. Jules Soury, thus
writes:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is to be feared that the
beautiful, the &lsquo;divine,&rsquo; dream, as he would say, which the
eminent scholar experienced in the very country of the Gospel, will
have the fate of the &lsquo;Joconda&rsquo; of Da Vinci, and many of the
religious pictures of Raphael and Michael Angelo. Such dreams are
admirable, but they are bound to fade.... The Jesus who rises up and
comes out from those old Judaizing writings (Synoptics) is truly no
idyllic personage, no meek dreamer, no mild and amiable moralist; on
the contrary, he is very much more of a Jew fanatic, attacking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>without measure the society of his time, a narrow
and obstinate visionary, a half-lucid thaumaturge, subject to fits of
passion, which caused him to be looked upon as crazy by his own people.
In the eyes of his contemporaries and fellow-countrymen he was all
that, and he is the same in ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renan himself repudiated to a considerable extent his earlier views
regarding Jesus. When he wrote his work he accepted as authentic the
Gospel of John, and to this Gospel he was indebted largely for the more
admirable traits of his hero. John he subsequently rejected. Mark he
accepted as the oldest and most authentic of the Gospels. Alluding to
Mark he says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It cannot be denied that Jesus is
portrayed in this gospel not as a meek moralist worthy of our
affection, but as a dreadful magician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This volume on &ldquo;The Christ&rdquo; was written by one who
recognizes in the Jesus of Strauss and Renan a transitional step, but
not the ultimate step, between orthodox Christianity and radical
Freethought. By the Christ is understood the Jesus of the New
Testament. The Jesus of the New Testament is the Christ of
Christianity. The Jesus of the New Testament is a supernatural being.
He is, like the Christ, a myth. He is the Christ myth. Originally the
word <i>Christ</i>, the Greek for the Jewish <i>Messiah</i>, &ldquo;the
anointed,&rdquo; meant the office or title of a person, while Jesus was
the name of the person on whom his followers had bestowed this title.
Gradually the title took the place of the name, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>so that
<i>Jesus</i>, <i>Jesus Christ</i>, and <i>Christ</i> became
interchangeable terms&mdash;synonyms. Such they are to the Christian
world, and such, by the law of common usage, they are to the secular
world.</p>
<p>It may be conceded as possible, and even probable, that a religious
enthusiast of Galilee, named Jesus, was the germ of this mythical Jesus
Christ. But this is an assumption rather than a demonstrated fact.
Certain it is, this person, if he existed, was not a realization of the
Perfect Man, as his admirers claim. There are passages in the Gospels
which ascribe to him a lofty and noble character, but these, for the
most part, betray too well their Pagan origin. The dedication of
temples to him and the worship of him by those who deny his divinity is
as irrational as it will prove ephemeral. One of the most philosophic
and one of the most far-seeing minds of Germany, Dr. Edward von
Hartmann, says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When liberal Protestantism demands
religious reverence for the <i>man</i> Jesus, it is disgusting and
shocking. They cannot themselves believe that the respect in which
Jesus is held by the people and which they have made use of in such an
unprotestant manner, can be maintained for any length of time after the
nimbus of divinity has been destroyed, and they may reflect on the
insufficiency of the momentary subterfuge. The Protestant principle in
its last consequences, disposes of all kinds of dogmatic authority in a
remorseless manner, and its supporters must, whether they like it or
not, dispense with the authority of Christ.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="first">The reader who accepts as divine the prevailing
religion of our land may consider this criticism on &ldquo;The
Christ&rdquo; irreverent and unjust. And yet for man&rsquo;s true
saviors I have no lack of reverence. For him who lives and labors to
uplift his fellow men I have the deepest reverence and respect, and at
the grave of him who upon the altar of immortal truth has sacrificed
his life I would gladly pay the sincere tribute of a mourner&rsquo;s
tears. It is not against the man Jesus that I write, but against the
Christ Jesus of theology; a being in whose name an Atlantic of innocent

<p class="first">Jesus of Nazareth, the Jesus of humanity, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=

death has awakened the sympathies of millions, is a possible character
and may have existed; but the Jesus of Bethlehem, the Christ of
Christianity, is an impossible character and does not exist.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end of this Christ&rsquo;s earthly career
he is represented by his alleged biographers as a supernatural being
endowed with superhuman powers. He is conceived without a natural
father: &ldquo;Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When, as
his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she
was found with child of the Holy Ghost&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%201:18">Matt. i,
18</a>).</p>
<p>His ministry is a succession of miracles. With a few loaves and
fishes he feeds a multitude: &ldquo;And when he had taken the five
loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed and
brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them;
and the two fishes divided he among them all. And they did all eat, and
were filled. And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and
of the fishes. And they that did eat of the loaves were about five
thousand men&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%206:41-44">Mark vi,

<p>He walks for miles upon the waters of the sea: &ldquo;And
straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to
go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
And when he had sent the multitudes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>away, he went up into a mountain
apart to pray; and when the evening was come, he was there alone. But
the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves; for the
wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto
them, walking on the sea&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>He bids a raging tempest cease and it obeys him: &ldquo;And there
arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that
it was now full.... And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto
the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great
calm&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>He withers with a curse the barren fig tree: &ldquo;And when he saw
a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but
leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee, henceforth,
forever. And presently the fig tree withered away&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>He casts out devils: &ldquo;And in the synagogue there was a man,
which had a spirit of an unclean devil.... And Jesus rebuked him,
saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had
thrown him in the midst, he came out of him and hurt him not&rdquo;

<p>He cures the incurable: &ldquo;And as he entered into a certain
village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off;
and they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>have
mercy on us. And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go show
yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went,
they were cleansed&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>He restores to life a widow&rsquo;s only son: &ldquo;And when he
came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried
out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and much people
of the city were with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion
on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier;
and they that bore him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto
thee, Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
delivered him to his mother&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>He revivifies the decaying corpse of Lazarus: &ldquo;Then said Jesus
unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.... Then when Jesus came, he found
that he had lain in the grave four days already.... And when he had
thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he
that was dead came forth&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>At his crucifixion nature is convulsed, and the inanimate dust of
the grave is transformed into living beings who walk the streets of
Jerusalem: &ldquo;Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice,
yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in
twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the
rocks rent; and the graves were opened; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb,
which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the
door of the sepulchre, and departed.... And, behold, there was a great
earthquake; for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came

<p>He ascends bodily into heaven: &ldquo;And he led them out as far as

<p>These and a hundred other miracles make up to a great extent this
so-called Gospel History of Christ. To disprove the existence of these
miracles is to disprove the existence of this Christ.</p>
<p>Canon Farrar makes this frank admission: &ldquo;If miracles be
incredible, Christianity is false. If Christ wrought no miracles, then
the Gospels are untrustworthy&rdquo; (Witness of History to Christ, p.
25).</p>
<p>Dean Mansel thus acknowledges the consequences <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>of the
successful denial of miracles: &ldquo;The whole system of Christian
belief with its evidences, ... all Christianity in short, so far as it
has any title to that name, so far as it has any special relation to
the person or the teaching of Christ, is overthrown&rdquo; (Aids to
Faith, p. 3).</p>
<p>Dr. Westcott says: &ldquo;The essence of Christianity lies in a
miracle; and if it can be shown that a miracle is either impossible or
incredible, all further inquiry into the details of its history is
superfluous&rdquo; (Gospel of the Resurrection, p. 34).</p>
<p>A miracle, in the orthodox sense of the term, is impossible and
incredible. To accept a miracle is to reject a demonstrated truth. The
world is governed, not by chance, not by caprice, not by special
providences, but by the laws of nature; and if there be one truth which
the scientist and the philosopher have established, it is this: THE
LAWS OF NATURE ARE IMMUTABLE. If the laws of Nature are immutable, they
cannot be suspended; for if they could be suspended, even by a god,
they would not be immutable. A single suspension of these laws would
prove their mutability. Now these alleged miracles of Christ required a
suspension of Nature&rsquo;s laws; and the suspension of these laws
being impossible the miracles were impossible, and not performed. If
these miracles were not performed, then the existence of this
supernatural and miracle-performing Christ, except <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>as a
creature of the human imagination, is incredible and impossible.</p>
<p>Hume&rsquo;s masterly argument against miracles has never been
refuted: &ldquo;A miracle is a violation of the laws of Nature; and as
a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof
against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as
any argument from experience can possibly be imagined. Why is it more
than probable that all men must die; that lead cannot of itself remain
suspended in the air; that fire consumes wood, and is extinguished by
water; unless it be that these events are found agreeable to the laws
of Nature, and there is required a violation of these laws, or, in
other words, a miracle, to prevent them? Nothing is esteemed a miracle
if it ever happens in the common course of Nature. It is no miracle
that a man, seemingly in good health, should die suddenly; because such
a kind of death, though more unusual than any other, has yet been
frequently observed to happen. But it is a miracle that a dead man
should come to life; because that has never been observed in any age or
country. There must, therefore, be a uniform experience against any
miraculous event, otherwise the event would not merit the appellation.
And as a uniform experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct
and full proof, from the nature of the fact, against the existence of
any miracle&rdquo; (Essay on Miracles). <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>Alluding to Christ&rsquo;s miracles, M. Renan, a reverential admirer
of Jesus of Nazareth, says: &ldquo;Observation, which has never been
once falsified, teaches us that miracles never happen but in times and
countries in which they are believed, and before persons disposed to
believe them. No miracle ever occurred in the presence of men capable
of testing its miraculous character..... It is not, then, in the name
of this or that philosophy, but in the name of universal experience,
that we banish miracles from history&rdquo; (Life of Jesus, p. 29).</p>
<p>Christianity arose in what was preeminently a miracle-working age.
Everything was attested by miracles, because nearly everybody believed
in miracles and demanded them. Every religious teacher was a worker of
miracles; and however trifling the miracle might be when wrought, in
this atmosphere of unbounded credulity, the breath of exaggeration soon
expanded it into marvelous proportions.</p>
<p>To show more clearly the character of the age which Christ
illustrates, let us take another example, the Pythagorean teacher,
Apollonius of Tyana, a contemporary of the Galilean. According to his
biographers&mdash;and they are as worthy of credence as the
Evangelists&mdash;his career, particularly in the miraculous events
attending it, bore a remarkable resemblance to that of Christ. Like
Christ, he was a divine incarnation; like Christ his miraculous
conception was announced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href=
"#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>before his birth; like Christ he
possessed in childhood the wisdom of a sage; like Christ he is said to
have led a blameless life; like Christ his moral teachings were
declared to be the best the world had known; like Christ he remained a
celibate; like Christ he was averse to riches; like Christ he purified
the religious temples; like Christ he predicted future events; like
Christ he performed miracles, cast out devils, healed the sick, and
restored the dead to life; like Christ he died, rose from the grave,
ascended to heaven, and was worshiped as a god.</p>
<p>The Christian rejects the miraculous in Apollonius because it is
incredible; the Rationalist rejects the miraculous in Christ for the
same reason. In proof of the human character of the religion of
Apollonius and the divine character of that of Christ it may be urged
that the former has perished, while the latter has survived. But this,
if it proves anything, proves too much. If the survival of Christianity
proves its divinity, then the survival of the miracle-attested faiths
of Buddhism and Mohammedanism, its powerful and nourishing rivals, must
prove their divinity also. The religion of Apollonius languished and
died because the conditions for its development were unfavorable; while
the religions of Buddha, Christ, and Mohammed lived and thrived because
of the propitious circumstances which favored their development.</p>
<p>With the advancement of knowledge the belief <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>in the
supernatural is disappearing. Those freed from Ignorance, and her dark
sister, Superstition, know that miracles are myths. In the words of
Matthew Arnold, &ldquo;Miracles are doomed; they will drop out like
fairies and witchcraft, from among the matter which serious people
believe&rdquo; (Literature and Dogma).</p>
<p>What proved the strength of Christianity in an age of ignorance is
proving its weakness in an age of intelligence. Christian scholars
themselves, recognizing the indefensibility and absurdity of miracles,
endeavor to explain away the difficulties attending their acceptance by
affirming that they are not real, but only apparent, violations of
Nature&rsquo;s laws; thus putting the miracles of Christ in the same
class with those performed by the jugglers of India and Japan. They
resolve the supernatural into the natural, that the incredible may
appear credible. With invincible logic and pitiless sarcasm Colonel
Ingersoll exposes the lameness of this attempt to retain the shadow of
the supernatural when the substance is gone:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Believers in miracles should not
try to explain them. There is but one way to explain anything, and that
is to account for it by natural agencies. The moment you explain a
miracle it disappears. You should not depend upon explanation, but
assertion. You should not be driven from the field because the miracle
is shown to be unreasonable. Neither should you be in the least
disheartened <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>if it is shown to be impossible. The possible is
not miraculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miracles must be dismissed from the domain of fact and relegated to
the realm of fiction. A miracle, I repeat, is impossible. Above all
this chief of miracles, The Christ, is impossible, and does not, and
never did, exist. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"

<p>Enough of the writings of the authors named in the foregoing list
remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan
literature, aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish
author, and two disputed passages in the works of Roman writers, there
is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Philo was born before the beginning of the Christian era, and lived
until long after the reputed death of Christ. He wrote an account of
the Jews covering the entire time that Christ is said to have existed
on earth. He was living in or near Jerusalem when Christ&rsquo;s
miraculous birth and the Herodian massacre occurred. He was there when
Christ made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. He was there when the
crucifixion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>with its attendant earthquake, supernatural
darkness, and resurrection of the dead took place&mdash;when Christ
himself rose from the dead, and in the presence of many witnesses
ascended into heaven. These marvelous events which must have filled the
world with amazement, had they really occurred, were unknown to him. It
was Philo who developed the doctrine of the Logos, or Word, and
although this Word incarnate dwelt in that very land and in the
presence of multitudes revealed himself and demonstrated his divine
powers, Philo saw it not.</p>
<p>Josephus, the renowned Jewish historian, was a native of Judea. He
was born in 37 A. D., and was a contemporary of the Apostles. He was,
for a time, Governor of Galilee, the province in which Christ lived and
taught. He traversed every part of this province and visited the places
where but a generation before Christ had performed his prodigies. He
resided in Cana, the very city in which Christ is said to have wrought
his first miracle. He mentions every noted personage of Palestine and
describes every important event which occurred there during the first
seventy years of the Christian era. But Christ was of too little
consequence and his deeds too trivial to merit a line from this
historian&rsquo;s pen.</p>
<p>Justus of Tiberius was a native of Christ&rsquo;s own country,
Galilee. He wrote a history covering the time of Christ&rsquo;s reputed
existence. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>work has perished, but Photius, a Christian
scholar and critic of the ninth century, who was acquainted with it,
says: &ldquo;He [Justus] makes not the least mention of the appearance
of Christ, of what things happened to him, or of the wonderful works
that he did&rdquo; (Photius&rsquo; Bibliotheca, code 33).</p>
<p>Judea, where occurred the miraculous beginning and marvelous ending
of Christ&rsquo;s earthly career, was a Roman province, and all of
Palestine is intimately associated with Roman history. But the Roman
records of that age contain no mention of Christ and his works. The
Greek writers of Greece and Alexandria who lived not far from Palestine
and who were familiar with its events, are silent also.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Late in the first century Josephus wrote his
celebrated work, &ldquo;The Antiquities of the Jews,&rdquo; giving a
history of his race from the earliest ages down to his own time. Modern
versions of this work contain the following passage:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now, there was about this time
Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer
of wonderful works; a teacher of such men as receive the truth with
pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the
Gentiles. He was [the] Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of
the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>cross,
those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared
to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold
these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the
tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this
day&rdquo; (Book XVIII, Chap. iii, sec. 3).</p>
<p>For nearly sixteen hundred years Christians have been citing this
passage as a testimonial, not merely to the historical existence, but
to the divine character of Jesus Christ. And yet a ranker forgery was
never penned.</p>
<p>Its language is Christian. Every line proclaims it the work of a
Christian writer. &ldquo;If it be lawful to call him a man.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He was the Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;He appeared to them alive again
the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten
thousand other wonderful things concerning him.&rdquo; These are the
words of a Christian, a believer in the divinity of Christ. Josephus
was a Jew, a devout believer in the Jewish faith&mdash;the last man in
the world to acknowledge the divinity of Christ. The inconsistency of
this evidence was early recognized, and Ambrose, writing in the
generation succeeding its first appearance (360 A. D.) offers the
following explanation, which only a theologian could frame: &ldquo;If
the Jews do not believe us, let them, at least, believe their own
writers. Josephus, whom they esteem a very great man, hath said this,
and yet hath he spoken truth after such a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>manner; and so far was
his mind wandered from the right way, that even he was not a believer
as to what he himself said; but thus he spake, in order to deliver
historical truth, because he thought it not lawful for him to deceive,
while yet he was no believer, because of the hardness of his heart, and
his perfidious intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its brevity disproves its authenticity. Josephus&rsquo; work is
voluminous and exhaustive. It comprises twenty books. Whole pages are
devoted to petty robbers and obscure seditious leaders. Nearly forty
chapters are devoted to the life of a single king. Yet this remarkable
being, the greatest product of his race, a being of whom the prophets
foretold ten thousand wonderful things, a being greater than any
earthly king, is dismissed with a dozen lines.</p>
<p>It interrupts the narrative. Section 2 of the chapter containing it
gives an account of a Jewish sedition which was suppressed by Pilate
with great slaughter. The account ends as follows: &ldquo;There were a
great number of them slain by this means, and others of them ran away
wounded; and thus an end was put to this sedition.&rdquo; Section 4, as
now numbered, begins with these words: &ldquo;About the same time also
another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder.&rdquo; The one section
naturally and logically follows the other. Yet between these two
closely connected paragraphs the one relating to Christ is placed; thus
making the words, &ldquo;another sad calamity,&rdquo; refer
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>to the advent of this wise and wonderful
being.</p>
<p>The early Christian fathers were not acquainted with it. Justin
Martyr, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen all would have
quoted this passage had it existed in their time. The failure of even
one of these fathers to notice it would be sufficient to throw doubt
upon its genuineness; the failure of all of them to notice it proves
conclusively that it is spurious, that it was not in existence during
the second and third centuries.</p>
<p>As this passage first appeared in the writings of the ecclesiastical
historian, Eusebius, as this author openly advocated the use of fraud
and deception in furthering the interests of the church, as he is known
to have mutilated and perverted the text of Josephus in other
instances, and as the manner of its presentation is calculated to
excite suspicion, the forgery has generally been charged to him. In his
&ldquo;Evangelical Demonstration,&rdquo; written early in the fourth
century, after citing all the known evidences of Christianity, he thus
introduces the Jewish historian: &ldquo;Certainly the attestations I
have already produced concerning our Savior may be sufficient. However,
it may not be amiss, if, over and above, we make use of Josephus the
Jew for a further witness&rdquo; (Book III, p. 124).</p>
<p>Chrysostom and Photius both reject this passage. Chrysostom, a
reader of Josephus, who preached and wrote in the latter part of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>fourth century, in his defense of Christianity,
needed this evidence, but was too honest or too wise to use it.
Photius, who made a revision of Josephus, writing five hundred years
after the time of Eusebius, ignores the passage, and admits that
Josephus has made no mention of Christ.</p>
<p>Modern Christian scholars generally concede that the passage is a
forgery. Dr. Lardner, one of the ablest defenders of Christianity,
adduces the following arguments against its genuineness:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not perceive that we at all
want the suspected testimony to Jesus, which was never quoted by any of
our Christian ancestors before Eusebius.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nor do I recollect that Josephus
has anywhere mentioned the name or word Christ, in any of his works;
except the testimony above mentioned, and the passage concerning James,
the Lord&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It interrupts the narrative.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The language is quite
Christian.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is not quoted by Chrysostom,
though he often refers to Josephus, and could not have omitted quoting
it had it been then in the text.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is not quoted by Photius,
though he has three articles concerning Josephus.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Under the article Justus of
Tiberias, this author (Photius) expressly states that the historian
[Josephus], being a Jew, has not taken the least notice of Christ.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Neither Justin in his dialogue
with Trypho the Jew, nor Clemens Alexandrinus, who made so many
extracts from ancient authors, nor Origen against Celsus, has ever
mentioned this testimony.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, on the contrary, in chapter
xxxv of the first book of that work, Origen openly affirms that
Josephus, who had mentioned John the Baptist, did not acknowledge
Christ&rdquo; (Answer to Dr. Chandler).</p>
<p>Again Dr. Lardner says: &ldquo;This passage is not quoted nor
referred to by any Christian writer before Eusebius, who flourished at
the beginning of the fourth century. If it had been originally in the
works of Josephus it would have been highly proper to produce it in
their disputes with Jews and Gentiles. But it is never quoted by Justin
Martyr, or Clement of Alexandria, nor by Tertullian or Origen, men of
great learning, and well acquainted with the works of Josephus. It was
certainly very proper to urge it against the Jews. It might also have
been fitly urged against the Gentiles. A testimony so favorable to
Jesus in the works of Josephus, who lived so soon after our Savior, who
was so well acquainted with the transactions of his own country, who
had received so many favors from Vespasian and Titus, would not be
overlooked or neglected by any Christian apologist&rdquo;
(Lardner&rsquo;s Works, vol. I, chap. iv).</p>
<p>Bishop Warburton declares it to be a forgery: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>&ldquo;If a Jew owned the truth of Christianity,
he must needs embrace it. We, therefore, certainly conclude that the
paragraph where Josephus, who was as much a Jew as the religion of
Moses could make him, is made to acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, in
terms as strong as words could do it, is a rank forgery, and a very
stupid one, too&rdquo; (Quoted by Lardner, Works, Vol. I, chap.
iv).</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Giles, of the Established Church of England, says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Those who are best acquainted with
the character of Josephus, and the style of his writings, have no
hesitation in condemning this passage as a forgery, interpolated in the
text during the third century by some pious Christian, who was
scandalized that so famous a writer as Josephus should have taken no
notice of the gospels, or of Christ, their subject. But the zeal of the
interpolator has outrun his discretion, for we might as well expect to
gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles, as to find this
notice of Christ among the Judaizing writings of Josephus. It is well
known that this author was a zealous Jew, devoted to the laws of Moses
and the traditions of his countrymen. How, then, could he have written
that Jesus was the Christ? Such an admission would have proved him to
be a Christian himself, in which case the passage under consideration,
too long for a Jew, would have been far too short for a believer in the
new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>religion, and thus the passage stands forth, like
an ill-set jewel, contrasting most inharmoniously with everything
around it. If it had been genuine, we might be sure that Justin Martyr,
Tertullian, and Chrysostom would have quoted it in their controversies
with the Jews, and that Origen or Photius would have mentioned it. But
Eusebius, the ecclesiastical historian (I, 11), is the first who quotes
it, and our reliance on the judgment or even honesty of this writer is
not so great as to allow our considering everything found in his works
as undoubtedly genuine&rdquo; (Christian Records, p. 30).</p>
<p>The Rev. S. Baring-Gould, in his &ldquo;Lost and Hostile
Gospels,&rdquo; says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This passage is first quoted by
Eusebius (fl. A. D. 315) in two places (Hist. Eccl., lib. i, c. xi;
Demonst. Evang., lib. iii); but it was unknown to Justin Martyr (fl. A.
D. 140), Clement of Alexandria (fl. A. D. 192), Tertullian (fl. A. D.
193), and Origen (fl. A. D. 230). Such a testimony would certainly have
been produced by Justin in his apology or in his controversy with
Trypho the Jew, had it existed in the copies of Josephus at his time.
The silence of Origen is still more significant. Celsus, in his book
against Christianity, introduces a Jew. Origen attacks the argument of
Celsus and his Jew. He could not have failed to quote the words of
Josephus, whose writings he knew, had the passage existed in the
genuine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>text. He, indeed, distinctly affirms that Josephus
did not believe in Christ (Contr. Cels. i).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Chalmers ignores it, and admits that Josephus is silent
regarding Christ. He says: &ldquo;The entire silence of Josephus upon
the subject of Christianity, though he wrote after the destruction of
Jerusalem, and gives us the history of that period in which Christ and
his Apostles lived, is certainly a very striking circumstance&rdquo;
(Kneeland&rsquo;s Review, p. 169).</p>
<p>Referring to this passage, Dean Milman, in his &ldquo;Gibbon&rsquo;s
Rome&rdquo; (Vol. II, p. 285, note) says: &ldquo;It is interpolated
with many additional clauses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Canon Farrar, who has written the ablest Christian life of Christ
yet penned, repudiates it. He says: &ldquo;The single passage in which
he [Josephus] alludes to him is interpolated, if not wholly
spurious&rdquo; (Life of Christ, Vol. I, p. 46).</p>
<p>The following, from Dr. Farrar&rsquo;s pen, is to be found in the
&ldquo;Encyclopedia Britannica&rdquo;: &ldquo;That Josephus wrote the
whole passage as it now stands no sane critic can believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There are, however, two reasons
which are alone sufficient to prove that the whole passage is
spurious&mdash;one that it was unknown to Origen and the earlier
fathers, and the other that its place in the text is uncertain&rdquo;
(Ibid).</p>
<p>Theodor Keim, a German-Christian writer on Jesus, says: &ldquo;The
passage cannot be maintained; it has first appeared in this form in the
Catholic church of the Jews and Gentiles, and under the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>dominion
of the Fourth Gospel, and hardly before the third century, probably
before Eusebius, and after Origen, whose bitter criticisms of Josephus
may have given cause for it&rdquo; (Jesus of Nazara, p. 25).</p>
<p>Concerning this passage, Hausrath, another German writer, says it
&ldquo;must have been penned at a peculiarly shameless hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Hooykaas, of Holland, says: &ldquo;Flavius Josephus,
the well known historian of the Jewish people, was born in A. D. 37,
only two years after the death of Jesus; but though his work is of
inestimable value as our chief authority for the circumstances of the
times in which Jesus and his Apostles came forward, yet he does not
seem to have mentioned Jesus himself. At any rate, the passage in his
&lsquo;Jewish Antiquities&rsquo; that refers to him is certainly
spurious, and was inserted by a later and a Christian hand&rdquo;
(Bible for Learners, Vol. III, p. 27). This conclusion of Dr. Hooykaas
is endorsed by the eminent Dutch critic, Dr. Kuenen.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander Campbell, one of America&rsquo;s ablest Christian
apologists, says: &ldquo;Josephus, the Jewish historian, was
contemporary with the Apostles, having been born in the year 37. From
his situation and habits, he had every access to know all that took
place at the rise of the Christian religion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Respecting the founder of this
religion, Josephus has thought fit to be silent in history.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>The present copies of his work contain one passage
which speaks very respectfully of Jesus Christ, and ascribes to him the
character of the Messiah. But as Josephus did not embrace Christianity,
and as this passage is not quoted or referred to until the beginning of
the fourth century, it is, for these and other reasons, generally
accounted spurious&rdquo; (Evidences of Christianity, from
Campbell-Owen Debate, p. 312).</p>
<p>Another passage in Josephus, relating to the younger Ananus, who was
high priest of the Jews in 62 A. D., reads as follows:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But this younger Ananus, who, as
we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in
his temper and very insolent; he was also of the sect of Sadducees, who
are very rigid in judging offenders, above all of the rest of the Jews,
as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this
disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity. Festus was
dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the Sanhedrim
of judges and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called
Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed
an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to
be stoned&rdquo; (Antiquities, Book XX, chap. ix, sec. 1).</p>
<p>This passage is probably genuine with the exception of the clause,
&ldquo;who was called Christ,&rdquo; which is undoubtedly an
interpolation, and is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>generally regarded as such. Nearly all the
authorities that I have quoted reject it. It was originally probably a
marginal note. Some Christian reader of Josephus believing that the
James mentioned was the brother of Jesus made a note of his belief in
the manuscript before him, and this a transcriber afterward
incorporated with the text, a very common practice in that age when
purity of text was a matter of secondary importance.</p>
<p>The fact that the early fathers, who were acquainted with Josephus,
and who would have hailed with joy even this evidence of Christ&rsquo;s
existence, do not cite it, while Origen expressly declares that
Josephus has not mentioned Christ, is conclusive proof that it did not
exist until the middle of the third century or later.</p>
<p>Those who affirm the genuineness of this clause argue that the James
mentioned by Josephus was a person of less prominence than the Jesus
mentioned by him, which would be true of James, the brother of Jesus
Christ. Now some of the most prominent Jews living at this time were
named Jesus. Jesus, the son of Damneus, succeeded Ananus as high priest
that very year; and Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, a little later
succeeded to the same office.</p>
<p>To identify the James of Josephus with James the Just, the brother
of Jesus, is to reject the accepted history of the primitive church
which declares that James the Just died in 69 A. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>D.,
seven years after the James of Josephus was condemned to death by the
Sanhedrim.</p>
<p>Whiston himself, the translator of Josephus, referring to the event
narrated by the Jewish historian, admits that James, the brother of
Jesus Christ, &ldquo;did not die till long afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brief &ldquo;Discourse Concerning Hades,&rdquo; appended to the
writings of Josephus, is universally conceded to be the product of some
other writer&mdash;&ldquo;obviously of Christian
origin&rdquo;&mdash;says the &ldquo;Encyclopedia Britannica.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Tacitus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In July, 64 A. D., a great conflagration occurred in
Rome. There is a tradition to the effect that this conflagration was
the work of an incendiary and that the Emperor Nero himself was
believed to be the incendiary. Modern editions of the
&ldquo;Annals&rdquo; of Tacitus contain the following passage in
reference to this:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nero, in order to stifle the
rumor, ascribed it to those people who were abhorred for their crimes
and commonly called Christians: These he punished exquisitely. <i>The
founder of that name was Christus, who, in the reign of Tiberius, was
punished as a criminal by the procurator, Pontius Pilate.</i> This
pernicious superstition, thus checked for awhile, broke out again; and
spread not only over Judea, the source of this evil, but reached the
city also: whither flow from all quarters all things vile and shameful,
and where they find shelter and encouragement. At <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>first,
only those were apprehended who confessed themselves of that sect;
afterwards, a vast multitude were detected by them, all of whom were
condemned, not so much for the crime of burning the city, as their
hatred of mankind. Their executions were so contrived as to expose them
to derision and contempt. Some were covered over with the skins of wild
beasts, and torn to pieces by dogs; some were crucified. Others, having
been daubed over with combustible materials, were set up as lights in
the night time, and thus burned to death. Nero made use of his own
gardens as a theatre on this occasion, and also exhibited the
diversions of the circus, sometimes standing in the crowd as a
spectator, in the habit of a charioteer; at other times driving a
chariot himself, till at length those men, though really criminal, and
deserving exemplary punishment, began to be commiserated as people who
were destroyed, not out of regard to the public welfare, but only to
gratify the cruelty of one man&rdquo; (Annals, Book XV, sec. 44).</p>
<p>This passage, accepted as authentic by many, must be declared
doubtful, if not spurious, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. It is not quoted by the Christian fathers.</p>
<p>2. Tertullian was familiar with the writings of Tacitus, and his
arguments demanded the citation of this evidence had it existed.</p>
<p>3. Clement of Alexandria, at the beginning of the third century,
made a compilation of all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>recognitions of Christ and
Christianity that had been made by Pagan writers up to his time. The
writings of Tacitus furnished no recognition of them.</p>
<p>4. Origen, in his controversy with Celsus, would undoubtedly have
used it had it existed.</p>
<p>5. The ecclesiastical historian Eusebius, in the fourth century,
cites all the evidences of Christianity obtainable from Jewish and
Pagan sources, but makes no mention of Tacitus.</p>
<p>6. It is not quoted by any Christian writer prior to the fifteenth
century.</p>
<p>7. At this time but one copy of the &ldquo;Annals&rdquo; existed,
and this copy, it is claimed, was made in the eighth century&mdash;600
years after the time of Tacitus.</p>
<p>8. As this single copy was in the possession of a Christian the
insertion of a forgery was easy.</p>
<p>9. Its severe criticisms of Christianity do not necessarily disprove
its Christian origin. No ancient witness was more desirable than
Tacitus, but his introduction at so late a period would make rejection
certain unless Christian forgery could be made to appear
improbable.</p>
<p>10. It is admitted by Christian writers that the works of Tacitus
have not been preserved with any considerable degree of fidelity. In
the writings ascribed to him are believed to be some of the writings of
Quintilian.</p>
<p>11. The blood-curdling story about the frightful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>orgies
of Nero reads like some Christian romance of the dark ages, and not
like Tacitus.</p>
<p>12. In fact, this story, in nearly the same words, omitting the
reference to Christ, is to be found in the writings of Sulpicius
Severus, a Christian of the fifth century.</p>
<p>13. Suetonius, while mercilessly condemning the reign of Nero, says
that in his public entertainments he took particular care that no human
lives should be sacrificed, &ldquo;not even those of condemned
criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>14. At the time that the conflagration occurred, Tacitus himself
declares that Nero was not in Rome, but at Antium.</p>
<p>Many who accept the authenticity of this section of the
&ldquo;Annals&rdquo; believe that the sentence which declares that
Christ was punished in the reign of Pontius Pilate, and which I have
italicized, is an interpolation. Whatever may be said of the remainder
of this passage, this sentence bears the unmistakable stamp of
Christian forgery. It interrupts the narrative; it disconnects two
closely related statements. Eliminate this sentence, and there is no
break in the narrative. In all the Roman records there was to be found
no evidence that Christ was put to death by Pontius Pilate. This
sentence, if genuine, is the most important evidence in Pagan
literature. That it existed in the works of the greatest and best known
of Roman historians, and was ignored or overlooked by Christian
apologists for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>1,360 years, no intelligent critic can believe.
Tacitus did not write this sentence.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This Roman author, early in the second century, while
serving as a pro-consul under Trajan in Bithynia, is reputed to have
written a letter to his Emperor concerning his treatment of Christians.
This letter contains the following:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have laid down this rule in
dealing with those who were brought before me for being Christians. I
asked whether they were Christians; if they confessed, I asked them a
second and a third time, threatening them with punishment; if they
persevered, I ordered them to be executed.... They assured me that
their only crime or error was this, that they were wont to come
together on a certain day before it was light, and to sing in turn,
among themselves, a hymn to Christ, as to a god, and to bind themselves
by an oath&mdash;not to do anything that was wicked, that they would
commit no theft, robbery, or adultery, nor break their word, nor deny
that anything had been entrusted to them when called upon to restore
it.... I therefore deemed it the more necessary to enquire of two
servant maids, who were said to be attendants, what was the real truth,
and to apply the torture. But I found it was nothing but a bad and
excessive superstition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding an alleged reply to this letter from Trajan, cited
by Tertullian and Eusebius, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href=
"#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>its genuineness may well be
questioned, and for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. The Roman laws accorded religious liberty to all, and the Roman
government tolerated and protected every religious belief. Renan says:
&ldquo;Among the Roman laws, anterior to Constantine, there was not a
single ordinance directed against freedom of thought; in the history of
the Pagan emperors not a single persecution on account of mere
doctrines or creeds&rdquo; (The Apostles). Gibbon says: &ldquo;The
religious tenets of the Galileans, or Christians, were never made a
subject of punishment, or even of inquiry&rdquo; (Rome, Vol. II, p.
215).</p>
<p>2. Trajan was one of the most tolerant and benevolent of Roman
emperors.</p>
<p>3. Pliny, the reputed author of the letter, is universally conceded
to have been one of the most humane and philanthropic of men.</p>
<p>4. It represents the distant province of Bithynia as containing, at
this time, a large Christian population, which is improbable.</p>
<p>5. It assumes that the Emperor Trajan was little acquainted with
Christian beliefs and customs, which cannot be harmonized with the
supposed historical fact that the most powerful of primitive churches
flourished in Trajan&rsquo;s capital and had existed for fifty
years.</p>
<p>6. Pliny represents the Christians as declaring that they were in
the habit of meeting and singing hymns &ldquo;to Christ as to a
god.&rdquo; The early <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"
name="pb45">45</a>]</span>Christians did not recognize Christ as a god,
and it was not until after the time of Pliny that he was worshiped as
such.</p>
<p>7. &ldquo;I asked whether they were Christians; if they confessed, I
asked them a second and a third time, threatening them with punishment;
if they persevered I ordered them to be executed.&rdquo; That this wise
and good man rewarded lying with liberty and truthfulness with death is
difficult to believe.</p>
<p>8. &ldquo;I therefore deemed it more necessary to inquire of two
servant maids, who were said to be attendants, what was the real truth,
and to apply the torture.&rdquo; Never have the person and character of
woman been held more sacred than they were in Pagan Rome. That one of
the noblest of Romans should have put to torture young women guiltless
of crime is incredible.</p>
<p>9. The declaration of the Christians that they took a solemn
obligation &ldquo;not to do anything that was wicked; that they would
commit no theft, robbery, or adultery, nor break their word,&rdquo;
etc., looks like an ingenious attempt to parade the virtues of
primitive Christians.</p>
<p>10. This letter, it is claimed, is to be found in but one ancient
copy of Pliny.</p>
<p>11. It was first quoted by Tertullian, and the age immediately
preceding Tertullian was notorious for Christian forgeries.</p>
<p>12. Some of the best German critics reject it. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>Gibbon,
while not denying its authenticity, pronounces it a &ldquo;very curious
epistle&rdquo;; and Dr. Whiston, who considers it too valuable to
discard, applies to its contents such epithets as &ldquo;amazing
doctrine!&rdquo; &ldquo;amazing stupidity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny&mdash;these are the disinterested witnesses
adduced by the church to prove the historical existence of Jesus
Christ; the one writing nearly one hundred years, the others one
hundred and ten years after his alleged birth; the testimony of two of
them self-evident forgeries, and that of the third a probable
forgery.</p>
<p>But even if the doubtful and hostile letter of Pliny be genuine, it
was not written until the second century, so that there is not to be
found in all the records of profane history prior to the second century
a single allusion to the reputed founder of Christianity.</p>
<p>To these witnesses is sometimes, though rarely, added a fourth,
Suetonius, a Roman historian who, like Tacitus and Pliny, wrote in the
second century. In his &ldquo;Life of Nero,&rdquo; Suetonius says:
&ldquo;The Christians, a race of men of a new and villainous
superstition, were punished.&rdquo; In his &ldquo;Life of
Claudius,&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;He [Claudius] drove the Jews, who at
the instigation of Chrestus were constantly rioting, out of
Rome.&rdquo; Of course no candid Christian will contend that Christ was
inciting Jewish riots at Rome fifteen years after he was crucified at
Jerusalem. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>Significant is the silence of the forty Jewish and Pagan writers
named in this chapter. This silence alone disproves Christ&rsquo;s
existence. Had this wonderful being really existed the earth would have
resounded with his fame. His mighty deeds would have engrossed every
historian&rsquo;s pen. The pages of other writers would have abounded
with references to him. Think of going through the literature of the
nineteenth century and searching in vain for the name of Napoleon
Bonaparte! Yet Napoleon was a pigmy and his deeds trifles compared with
this Christ and the deeds he is said to have performed.</p>
<p>With withering irony Gibbon notes this ominous silence: &ldquo;But
how shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic
world, to those evidences which were represented by the hand of
Omnipotence, not to their reason, but to their senses? During the age
of Christ, of his apostles, and of their first disciples, the doctrine
which they preached was confirmed by innumerable prodigies. The lame
walked, the blind saw, the sick were healed, the dead were raised,
demons were expelled, and the laws of Nature were frequently suspended
for the benefit of the church. But the sages of Greece and Rome turned
aside from the awful spectacle, and, pursuing the ordinary occupations
of life and study, appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral
or physical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>government of the world. Under the reign of
Tiberius, the whole earth, or at least a celebrated province of the
Roman empire, was involved in a preternatural darkness of three hours.
Even this miraculous event, which ought to have excited the wonder, the
curiosity, and the devotion of mankind, passed without notice in an age
of science and history. It happened during the lifetime of Seneca and
the elder Pliny, who must have experienced the immediate effects, or
received the earliest intelligence of the prodigy. Each of these
philosophers, in a laborious work, has recorded all the great phenomena
of Nature, earthquakes, meteors, comets, and eclipses, which his
indefatigable curiosity could collect. Both the one and the other have
omitted to mention the greatest phenomenon to which the mortal eye has
been witness since the creation of the globe&rdquo; (Rome, Vol. I, pp.
588&ndash;590).</p>
<p>Even conceding, for the sake of argument, both the authenticity and
the credibility of these passages attributed to the Roman historians,
what do they prove? Do they prove that Christ was divine&mdash;that he
was a supernatural being, as claimed? No more than do the writings of
Paine and Voltaire, which also contain his name. This evidence is
favorable not to the adherents, but to the opponents, of Christianity.
If these passages be genuine, and their authors have penned historical
truths, it simply confirms <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>what most Rationalists admit, that a
religious sect called Christians, who recognized Christ as their
founder, existed as early as the first century; and confirms what some
have charged, but what the church is loath to admit, that primitive
Christians, who have been declared the highest exemplars of human
virtue, were the most depraved of villains.</p>
<p>An unlettered and credulous enthusiast, named Jones, imagines that
he has had a revelation, and proceeds to found a new religious sect. He
gathers about him a band of &ldquo;disciples&rdquo; as ignorant and
credulous as himself. He soon gets into trouble and is killed. But the
Jonesists increase&mdash;increase in numbers and in
meanness&mdash;until at length they become sufficiently notorious to
receive a paragraph from an annalist who, after holding them up to
ridicule and scorn, accounts for their origin by stating that they take
their name from one Jones who, during the administration of President
Roosevelt, was hanged as a criminal. The world contains two billions of
inhabitants&mdash;mostly fools, as Carlyle would say&mdash;and as the
religion of this sect is a little more foolish than that of any other
sect, it continues to spread until at the end of two thousand years it
covers the globe. Then think of the adherents of this religion citing
the uncomplimentary allusion of this annalist to prove that Jones was a
god! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=

<h3 class="main">The Four Gospels.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Farrar, in his &ldquo;Life of Christ,&rdquo; concedes
and deplores the dearth of evidence concerning the subject of his work.
He says: &ldquo;It is little short of amazing that neither history nor
tradition should have embalmed for us one certain or precious saying or
circumstance in the life of the Savior of Mankind, except the
comparatively few events recorded in four very brief
biographies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these four brief biographies, the Four Gospels, Christianity
must stand or fall. These four documents, it is admitted, contain
practically all the evidence which can be adduced in proof of the
existence and divinity of Jesus Christ. Profane history, as we have
seen, affords no proof of this. The so-called apocryphal literature of
the early church has been discarded by the church itself. Even the
remaining canonical books of the New Testament are of little
consequence if the testimony of the Four Evangelists be successfully
impeached. Disprove the authenticity and credibility of these documents
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>and this Christian deity is removed to the
mythical realm of Apollo, Odin, and Osiris.</p>
<p>In a previous work, &ldquo;The Bible,&rdquo; I have shown that the
books of the New Testament, with a few exceptions, are not authentic.
This evidence cannot be reproduced here in full. A brief summary of it
must suffice.</p>
<p>The Four Gospels, it is claimed, were written by Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John, two of them apostles, and two companions of the
apostles of Christ. If this claim be true the other writings of the
apostles, the writings of the Apostolic Fathers, and the writings of
the early Christian Fathers, ought to contain some evidences of the
fact.</p>
<p>Twenty books&mdash;nearly all of the remaining books of the New
Testament&mdash;are said to have been written by the three apostles,
Peter, John, and Paul, a portion of them after the first three Gospels
were written; but it is admitted that they contain no evidence whatever
of the existence of these Gospels.</p>
<p>There are extant writings accredited to the Apostolic Fathers,
Clement of Rome, Barnabas, Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp; written, for
the most part, early in the second century. These writings contain no
mention of the Four Gospels. This also is admitted by Christian
scholars. Dr. Dodwell says: &ldquo;We have at this day certain most
authentic ecclesiastical writers of the times, as Clemens Romanus,
Barnabas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp, who wrote in the
order wherein I have named them, and after all the writers of the New
Testament. But in Hermas you will not find one passage or any mention
of the New Testament, nor in all the rest is any one of the Evangelists
named&rdquo; (Dissertations upon Irenaeus).</p>
<p>The Four Gospels were unknown to the early Christian Fathers. Justin
Martyr, the most eminent of the early Fathers, wrote about the middle
of the second century. His writings in proof of the divinity of Christ
demanded the use of these Gospels had they existed in his time. He
makes more than three hundred quotations from the books of the Old
Testament, and nearly one hundred from the Apocryphal books of the New
Testament; but none from the Four Gospels. The Rev. Dr. Giles says:
&ldquo;The very names of the Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John, are never mentioned by him [Justin]&mdash;do not occur once in
all his writings&rdquo; (Christian Records, p. 71).</p>
<p>Papias, another noted Father, was a contemporary of Justin. He
refers to writings of Matthew and Mark, but his allusions to them
clearly indicate that they were not the Gospels of Matthew and Mark.
Dr. Davidson, the highest English authority on the canon, says:
&ldquo;He [Papias] neither felt the want nor knew the existence of
inspired Gospels&rdquo; (Canon of the Bible, p. 123). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>Theophilus, who wrote after the middle of the latter half of the
second century, mentions the Gospel of John, and Irenaeus, who wrote a
little later, mentions all of the Gospels, and makes numerous
quotations from them. In the latter half of the second century, then,
between the time of Justin and Papias, and the time of Theophilus and
Irenaeus, the Four Gospels were undoubtedly written or compiled.</p>
<p>These books are anonymous. They do not purport to have been written
by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Their titles do not affirm it. They
simply imply that they are &ldquo;according&rdquo; to the supposed
teachings of these Evangelists. As Renan says, &ldquo;They merely
signify that these were the traditions proceeding from each of these
Apostles, and claiming their authority.&rdquo; Concerning their
authorship the Rev. Dr. Hooykaas says: &ldquo;They appeared
anonymously. The titles placed above them in our Bibles owe their
origin to a later ecclesiastical tradition which deserves no confidence
whatever&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, Vol. III, p. 24).</p>
<p>It is claimed that the Gospel of Matthew originally appeared in
Hebrew. Our version is a translation of a Greek work. Regarding this
St. Jerome says: &ldquo;Who afterwards translated it into Greek is not
sufficiently certain.&rdquo; The consequences of this admission are
thus expressed by Michaelis: &ldquo;If the original text of Matthew is
lost, and we have nothing but a Greek translation; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>then,
frankly, we cannot ascribe any divine inspiration to the
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contents of these books refute the claim that they were written
by the Evangelists named. They narrate events and contain doctrinal
teachings which belong to a later age. Matthew ascribes to Christ the
following language: &ldquo;Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
build my church&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2016:18">xvi, 18</a>).
This Gospel is a Roman Catholic Gospel, and was written after the
beginning of the establishment of this hierarchy to uphold the
supremacy of the Petrine Church of Rome. Of this Gospel Dr. Davidson
says: &ldquo;The author, indeed, must ever remain unknown&rdquo;
(Introduction to New Testament, p. 72).</p>
<p>The Gospel of Luke is addressed to Theophilus. Theophilus, Bishop of
Antioch, who is believed to be the person addressed, flourished in the
latter half of the second century.</p>
<p>Dr. Schleiermacher, one of Germany&rsquo;s greatest theologians,
after a critical analysis of Luke, concludes that it is merely a
compilation, made up of thirty-three preexisting manuscripts. Bishop
Thirlwall&rsquo;s Schleiermacher says: &ldquo;He [Luke] is from
beginning to end no more than the compiler and arranger of documents
which he found in existence&rdquo; (p. 313).</p>
<p>The basis of this Gospel is generally believed to be the Gospel of
Marcion, a Pauline compilation, made about the middle of the second
century. Concerning this Gospel, the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>in his
&ldquo;Lost and Hostile Gospels,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The arrangement is
so similar that we are forced to the conclusion that it was either used
by St. Luke or that it was his original composition. If he used it then
his right to the title of author of the Third Gospel falls to the
ground, as what he added was of small amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark, according to Renan, is the oldest of the Gospels; but Mark,
according to Strauss, was written after the Gospels of Matthew and Luke
were written. He says: &ldquo;It is evidently a compilation, whether
made from memory or otherwise, from the first and third Gospels&rdquo;
(<span lang="de">Leben Jesu</span>, p. 51). Judge Waite, in his
&ldquo;History of Christianity,&rdquo; says that all but twenty-four
verses of this Gospel have their parallels in Matthew and Luke.
Davidson declares it to be an anonymous work. &ldquo;The author,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;is unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Omitting the last twelve verses of Mark, which all Christian critics
pronounce spurious, the book contains no mention of the two great
miracles which mark the limits of Christ&rsquo;s earthly career, his
miraculous birth and his ascension.</p>
<p>Concerning the first three Gospels, the &ldquo;Encyclopedia
Britannica&rdquo; says: &ldquo;It is certain that the Synoptic Gospels
took their present form only by degrees.&rdquo; Of these books Dr.
Westcott says: &ldquo;Their substance is evidently much older than
their form.&rdquo; Professor Robertson Smith pronounces them
&ldquo;unapostolic digests of the second century.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>The internal evidence against the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel
is conclusive. The Apostle John did not write it. John, the apostle,
was a Jew; the author of the Fourth Gospel was not a Jew. John was born
at Bethsaida; the author of the Fourth Gospel did not know where
Bethsaida was located. John was an uneducated fisherman; the author of
this Gospel was an accomplished scholar. Some of the most important
events in the life of Jesus, the Synoptics declare, were witnessed by
John; the author of this knows nothing of these events. The Apostle
John witnessed the crucifixion; the author of this Gospel did not. The
Apostles, including John, believed Jesus to be a man; the author of the
Fourth Gospel believed him to be a god.</p>
<p>Regarding the authorship of the Fourth Gospel, Dr. Davidson says:
&ldquo;The Johannine authorship has receded before the tide of modern
criticism, and though this tide is arbitrary at times, it is here
irresistible&rdquo; (Canon of the Bible, p. 127).</p>
<p>That the authenticity of the Four Gospels cannot be maintained is
conceded by every impartial critic. The author of &ldquo;Supernatural
Religion,&rdquo; in one of the most profound and exhaustive works on
this subject ever written, expresses the result of his labors in the
following words: &ldquo;After having exhausted the literature and the
testimony bearing on the point, we have not found a single distinct
trace of any of those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span>Gospels during the first century and a half
after the death of Jesus&rdquo; (Supernatural Religion, Vol. II, p.
248).</p>
<p>Fifteen hundred years ago, Bishop Faustus, a heretical Christian
theologian, referring to this so-called Gospel history, wrote:
&ldquo;It is allowed not to have been written by the son himself nor by
his apostles, but long after by some unknown men who, lest they should
be suspected of writing things they knew nothing of, gave to their
books the names of the Apostles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is the verdict of the world&rsquo;s greatest Bible
critic, Baur: &ldquo;These Gospels are spurious, and were written in
the second century.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Acts, Catholic Epistles, and Revelation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Acts of the Apostles is supposed to have been
written by the author of the Third Gospel. Like this book it is
anonymous and of late origin. It contains historical inaccuracies,
contradicts the Gospel of Matthew, and conflicts with the writings of
Paul. Concerning the last, the &ldquo;Bible for Learners&rdquo; (Vol.
III, p. 25) says: &ldquo;In the first two chapters of the Epistle to
the Galatians, he [Paul] gives us several details of his own past life;
and no sooner do we place his story side by side with that of the Acts
than we clearly perceive that this book contains an incorrect account,
and that its inaccuracy is not the result of accident or ignorance, but
of a deliberate design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book purports to be the product chiefly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>of three
minds: that of the author who gives a historical sketch of the early
church, and those of Peter and Paul whose discourses are reported. And
yet the three compositions are clearly the products of one
mind&mdash;that of the author. The evident purpose of the work is to
heal the bitter dissensions which existed between the Petrine and
Pauline churches, and this points unmistakably to the latter part of
the second century as the date of its appearance, when the work of
uniting the various Christian sects into the Catholic church began.
Renan considers this the most faulty book of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The seven Catholic Epistles, James, First and Second Peter, First,
Second and Third John, and Jude, have never been held in very high
esteem by the church. Many of the Christian Fathers rejected them,
while modern Christian scholars have generally considered them of
doubtful authenticity. The first and last of these were rejected by
Martin Luther. &ldquo;St. James&rsquo; Epistle,&rdquo; says Luther,
&ldquo;is truly an epistle of straw&rdquo; (Preface to Luther&rsquo;s
New Testament, ed. 1524). Jude, he says, &ldquo;is an abstract or copy
of St. Peter&rsquo;s Second, and allegeth stories and sayings which
have no place in Scripture&rdquo; (Standing Preface).</p>
<p>The First Epistle of Peter and the First Epistle of John have
generally been accorded a higher degree of authority than the others;
but even these were not written by apostles, nor in the first century.
Dr. Soury says that First <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>Peter &ldquo;dates, in all
probability, from the year 130 A. D., at the earliest&rdquo; (Jesus and
the Gospels, p. 32). Irenaeus, the founder of the New Testament canon,
rejected it. The Dutch critics, who deny the Johannine authorship of
the Fourth Gospel, and assign its composition to the second century,
say: &ldquo;The First Epistle of John soon issued from the same school
in imitation of the Gospel&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, Vol. III, p.
692).</p>
<p>Second Peter is a forgery. Westcott says there is no proof of its
existence prior to 170 A. D. Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible
Dictionary&rdquo; says &ldquo;Many reject the epistle as altogether
spurious.&rdquo; The brief epistles of Second and Third John are
anonymous and of very late origin. They do not purport to be the
writings of John. The superscriptions declare them to be from an elder,
and this precludes the claim that they are from an apostle. The early
Fathers ignored them.</p>
<p>Revelation is the only book in the Bible which claims to be the word
of God. At the same time it is the book of which Christians have always
been the most suspicious. It is addressed to the seven churches of
Asia, but the seven churches of Asia rejected it. Concerning the
attitude of ancient churchmen toward it, Dionysius, Bishop of
Alexandria, says: &ldquo;Divers of our predecessors have wholly refused
and rejected this book, and by discussing the several parts thereof
have found it obscure and void of reason and the title forged.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The most learned and intelligent
of Protestant divines,&rdquo; says the Edinburgh Review, &ldquo;almost
all doubted or denied the canonicity of the book of Revelation.&rdquo;
It is a book which, Dr. South said, &ldquo;either found a man mad or
left him so.&rdquo; Calvin and Beza both forbade their clergy to
attempt an explanation of its contents. Luther says: &ldquo;In the
Revelation of John much is wanting to let me deem it either prophetic
or apostolical&rdquo; (Preface to N. T., 1524).</p>
<p>Considered as evidences of Christ&rsquo;s historical existence and
divinity these nine books are of no value. They are all anonymous
writings or forgeries, and, with the possible exception of Revelation,
of very late origin. While they affirm Christ&rsquo;s existence they
are almost entirely silent regarding his life and miracles.</p>
</div>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Epistles of Paul.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the fourteen epistles ascribed to Paul,
seven&mdash;Ephesians, Colossians, Second Thessalonians, First and
Second Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews&mdash;are conceded by nearly all
critics to be spurious, while three others&mdash;Philippians, First
Thessalonians, and Philemon&mdash;are generally classed as
doubtful.</p>
<p>The general verdict concerning the first seven is thus expressed by
the Rev. Dr. Hooykaas: &ldquo;Fourteen epistles are said to be
Paul&rsquo;s; but we must at once strike off one, namely, that to the
Hebrews, which does not bear his name at all. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>... The
two letters to Timothy and the letter to Titus were certainly composed
long after the death of Paul.... It is more than possible that the
letters to the Ephesians and Colossians are also unauthentic, and the
same suspicion rests, perhaps, on the first, but certainly on the
second of the Epistles to the Thessalonians&rdquo; (Bible for Learners,
Vol. III, p. 23).</p>
<p>The author of Second Thessalonians, whose epistle is a self-evident
forgery, declares First Thessalonians to be a forgery. Baur and the
Tubingen school reject both Epistles. Baur also rejects Philippians:
&ldquo;The Epistles to the Colossians and to the Philippians ... are
spurious, and were written by the Catholic school near the end of the
second century, to heal the strife between the Jew and the Gentile
factions&rdquo; (Paulus). Dr. Kuenen and the other Dutch critics admit
that Philippians and Philemon, as well as First Thessalonians, are
doubtful.</p>
<p>That the Pastoral Epistles are forgeries is now conceded by all
critics. According to the German critics they belong to the second
century. Hebrews does not purport to be a Pauline document. Luther
says: &ldquo;The Epistle to the Hebrews is not by St. Paul, nor,
indeed, by any apostle&rdquo; (Standing Preface to Luther&rsquo;s N.
T.).</p>
<p>Four Epistles&mdash;Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and
Galatians&mdash;while rejected by a few critics, are generally admitted
to be the genuine writings of Paul. These books were written, it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>is claimed, about a quarter of a century after the
death of Christ. They are the only books of the New Testament whose
authenticity can be maintained.</p>
<p>Admitting the authenticity of these books, however, is not admitting
the historical existence of Christ and the divine origin of
Christianity. Paul was not a witness of the alleged events upon which
Christianity rests. He did not become a convert to Christianity until
many years after the death of Christ. He did not see Christ (save in a
vision); he did not listen to his teachings; he did not learn from his
disciples. &ldquo;The Gospel which was preached of me is not after man,
for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201:11-12">Gal.
i, 11, 12</a>). Paul accepted only to a very small extent the religion
of Christ&rsquo;s disciples. He professed to derive his knowledge from
supernatural sources&mdash;from trances and visions. Regarding the
value of such testimony the author of &ldquo;Supernatural
Religion&rdquo; (p. 970) says: &ldquo;No one can deny, and medical and
psychological annals prove, that many men have been subject to visions
and hallucinations which have never been seriously attributed to
supernatural causes. There is not one single valid reason removing the
ecstatic visions and trances of the Apostle Paul from this
class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporeal existence of the Christ of the Evangelists receives
slight confirmation in the writings of Paul. His Christ was not the
incarnate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=

<p class="first">We have seen that the Four Gospels are not authentic,
that they are anonymous writings which appeared late in the second
century. If their contents seemed credible and their statements
harmonized with each other this want of authenticity would invalidate
their authority, because the testimony of an unknown witness cannot be
accepted as authoritative. On the other hand, if their authenticity
could be established, if it could be shown that they were written by
the authors claimed, the incredible and contradictory character of
their contents would destroy their authority.</p>
<p>As historical documents these books are hardly worthy of credit. The
&ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; is almost as worthy of credit as the Four
Gospels. In both are to be found accounts of things possible and of
things impossible. To believe the impossible is gross superstition; to
believe the possible, simply because it is possible, is blind
credulity. These books are adduced as the credentials of Christ. A
critical analysis of these credentials reveals hundreds of errors. A
presentation of these errors will occupy the five <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=

shown that they contain errors, however trivial some of them may
appear, this refutes the claim of inerrancy and divinity. If it can be
shown that they abound with errors, this destroys their credibility as
historical documents. Destroy the credibility of the Four Gospels and
you destroy all proofs of Christ&rsquo;s divinity&mdash;all proofs of
his existence.</p>

<p class="first">When was Jesus born?</p>
<p>Matthew: &ldquo;In the days of Herod&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=

<p>Luke: &ldquo;When Cyrenius was governor of Syria&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%202:1-7">ii,
1&ndash;7</a>).</p>
<p>Nearly every biographer gives the date of his subject&rsquo;s birth.
Yet not one of the Evangelists gives the date of Jesus&rsquo; birth.
Two, Matthew and Luke, attempt to give the time approximately. But
between these two attempts there is a discrepancy of at least ten
years; for Herod died 4 B. C., while Cyrenius did not become governor
of Syria until 7 A. D.</p>
<p>A reconciliation of these statements is impossible. Matthew clearly
states that Jesus was born during the reign of Herod. Luke states that
Augustus Caesar issued a decree that the world should be taxed, that
&ldquo;this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
Syria,&rdquo; and that Jesus was born at the time of this taxing.</p>
<p>The following extracts from Josephus, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>renowned
historian of the race and country to which Jesus belonged, give the
date of this taxing and the time that elapsed between the death of
Herod and the taxing, and which reckoned backward from this gives the
date of Herod&rsquo;s death:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And now Herod altered his
testament upon the alteration of his mind; for he appointed Antipas, to
whom he had before left his kingdom, to be tetrarch of Galilee and
Berea, and granted the kingdom to Archelaus.... When he had done these
things he died&rdquo; (Antiquities, B. xvii, ch. 8, sec. 1).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But in the tenth year of
Archelaus&rsquo;s government, both his brethren, and the principal men
of Judea and Samaria, not being able to bear his barbarous and
tyrannical usage of them, accused him before Caesar.... And when he was
come [to Rome], Caesar, upon hearing what certain accusers of his had
to say, and what reply he could make, both banished him, and appointed
Vienna, a city of Gaul, to be the place of his habitation, and took his
money away from him&rdquo; (Ibid, ch. 13, sec. 2).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Archelaus&rsquo;s country was laid
to the province of Syria; and Cyrenius, one that had been consul, was
sent by Caesar to take account of people&rsquo;s effects in Syria, and
to sell the house of Archelaus&rdquo; (Ib. sec. 5).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When Cyrenius had now disposed of
Archelaus&rsquo;s money, and when the taxings were come <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>to a
conclusion, which were made in the thirty-seventh of Caesar&rsquo;s
victory over Antony at <span class="corr" id="xd21e1068" title=
"Source: Actim">Actium</span>,&rdquo; etc. (Ib., B. xviii, ch. 2, sec.
1).</p>
<p>The battle of Actium was fought September 2, B. C. 31. The
thirty-seventh year from this battle comprehended the time elapsing
between September 2, A. D. 6, and September 2, A. D. 7, the mean of
which was March 2, A. D. 7. The mean of the tenth year preceding
this&mdash;the year in which Herod died&mdash;was September 2, B. C.
4.</p>
<p>It has been suggested by some unacquainted with Roman history that
Cyrenius [Quirinus] may have been twice governor of Syria. Cyrenius was
but once governor of Syria, and this not until 7 A. D. During the last
years of Herod&rsquo;s reign, and during all the years of
Archelaus&rsquo;s reign, Sentius Saturninus and Quintilius Varus held
this office. Even if Cyrenius had previously held the office the events
related by Luke could not have occurred then because Judea prior to 7
A. D. was not a part of Syria.</p>
<p>The second chapter of Luke which narrates the birth and infancy of
Jesus, conflicts with the first chapter of this book. In this chapter
it is expressly stated that Zacharias, the priest, lived in the time of
Herod and, inferentially, that the conceptions of John and Jesus
occurred at this time.</p>
<p>Christian chronology, by which events are supposed to be reckoned
from the birth of Christ, agrees with neither Matthew nor Luke,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>but dates from a point nearly intermediate between
the two. According to Matthew, Christ was born at least five years
before the beginning of the Christian era; according to Luke he was
born at least six years after the beginning of the Christian era. This
is 1907: but according to Matthew Christ was born not later than 1912
years ago; while according to Luke he was born not earlier than 1901
years ago.</p>
<p>At least ten different opinions regarding the year of Christ&rsquo;s
birth have been advanced by Christian scholars. Dodwell places it in 6
B. C., Chrysostom 5 B. C., Usher, whose opinion is most commonly
received, 4 B. C., Irenaeus 3 B. C., Jerome 2 B. C., Tertullian 1 B. C.
Some modern authorities place it in 1 A. D., others in 2 A. D., and
still others in 3 A. D.; while those who accept Luke as infallible
authority must place it as late as 7 A. D.</p>

<p class="first">It is generally assumed that Jesus was born in the
last year of Herod&rsquo;s reign. How long before the close of

<p>Matthew says that when the wise men visited Herod he diligently
inquired of them the time when the star which announced the birth of
Jesus first appeared. When he determined to destroy Jesus and massacred
the infants of Bethlehem and the surrounding country, he slew those
&ldquo;from two years old and under, according <span class=

time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men,&rdquo; clearly
indicating that Jesus was nearly or quite two years old at this
time.</p>
<p>In attempting to reconcile Matthew&rsquo;s visit of the wise men to
Jesus at Bethlehem with the narrative of Luke, which makes his stay
there less than six weeks, it has been assumed that this visit occurred
immediately after his birth, whereas, according to Matthew, it did not
occur until about two years after his birth.</p>

<p>Not one of his biographers is prepared to tell; primitive Christians
did not know; the church has never been able to determine this. A
hundred different opinions regarding it have been expressed by
Christian scholars. Wagenseil places it in February, Paulius in March,
Greswell in April, Lichtenstein in June, Strong in August, Lightfoot in
September, and Newcome in October. Clinton says that he was born in the
Spring; Larchur says that he was born in the Fall. Some early
Christians believed that it occurred on the 5th of January; others the
19th of April; others still on the 20th of May. The Eastern church
believed that he was born on the 7th of January. The church of Rome, in
the fourth century, selected the 25th of December on which to celebrate
the anniversary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=

<p class="first">What determined the selection of this date?</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There was a double reason for
selecting this day. In the first place it had been observed from a
hoary antiquity as a heathen festival, following the longest night of
the winter solstice, and was called &lsquo;the Birthday of the
Unconquerable Sun.<span class="corr" id="xd21e1116" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> It was a fine thought to celebrate on
that day the birth of him whom the Gospel called &ldquo;the light of
the world&rdquo;.... The second reason was, that at Rome the days from
the 17th to the 23d of December were devoted to unbridled merrymaking.
These days were called the Saturnalia.... Now the church was always
anxious to meet the heathen, whom she had converted or was beginning to
convert, half-way, by allowing them to retain the feasts they were
accustomed to, only giving them a Christian dress, or attaching a new
and Christian signification to them&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, vol.
iii, pp. 66, 67).</p>
<p>Gibbon says: &ldquo;The Roman Christians, ignorant of the real time
of the birth of Jesus, fixed the solemn festival on the 25th of
December, the winter solstice when the Pagans annually celebrated the
birth of the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luke: At the time of his birth &ldquo;there were in the same country

night&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%202:8">ii, 8</a>).</p>
<p>Shepherds did not abide in the field with their flocks at night in
mid-winter. The Rev. Cunningham Geikie, D. D., a leading English
orthodox authority on Christ, says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;One knows how wretched even Rome
is in winter and Palestine is much worse during hard weather. Nor is it
likely that shepherds would lie out through the night, except during
unseasonably fine weather&rdquo; (Christmas at Bethlehem, in
Deems&rsquo; Holydays and Holidays, p. 405).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The nativity of Jesus in December
should be given up.&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Adam Clarke.</p>
<p>In regard to the date of Christ&rsquo;s birth Dr. Farrar says:
&ldquo;It must be admitted that we cannot demonstrate the exact year of
the nativity.... As to the day and month of the nativity it is certain
that they can never be recovered; they were absolutely unknown to the
early fathers, and there is scarcely one month of the year which has
not been fixed upon as probable by modern critics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inability of Christians to determine the date of Christ&rsquo;s
birth is one of the strongest proofs of his non-existence as a
historical character. Were the story of his miraculous birth and
marvelous life true the date of his birth <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Aside from these stories in Matthew and Luke concerning the
nativity, which are clearly of later origin than the remaining
documents composing the books and which many Christian scholars reject,
there is not a word in the Four Gospels to confirm the claim that Jesus
was born in Bethlehem. Every statement in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John, as well as Acts, concerning his nativity, is to the effect that
he was born in Nazareth of Galilee. He is never called &ldquo;Jesus of
Bethlehem,&rdquo; but always &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo; According
to modern usage &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth&rdquo; might merely signify
that Nazareth was the place of his residence and not necessarily the
place of his birth. But this usage was unknown to the Jews. Had he been
born at Bethlehem, he would, according to the Jewish custom, have been
called &ldquo;Jesus of Bethlehem,&rdquo; because the place of birth
always determined this distinguishing adjunct, and the fact of his
having removed to another place would not have changed it.</p>

<p>Many of the Jews rejected Christ because he was born in Galilee and
not in Bethlehem. &ldquo;Others said, This is the Christ. But some
said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? Hath not the scriptures said,
That Christ cometh out of the seed of David, and out of the town of
Bethlehem, where David was?&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

41, 42</a>).</p>
<p>Concerning this subject the &ldquo;Bible for Learners&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;The primitive tradition declared emphatically that Nazareth was
the place from which Jesus came. We may still see this distinctly
enough in our Gospels. Jesus is constantly called the Nazarene, or
Jesus of Nazareth. This was certainly the name by which he was known in
his own time; and of course such local names were given to men from the
place of their birth, and not from the place in which they lived, which
might constantly be changing. Nazareth is called in so many words
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>his own, that is his native city, and he himself
declares it so&rdquo; (vol. iii, pp. 39, 40).</p>
<p>That Jesus the man, if such a being existed, was not born at
Bethlehem is affirmed by all critics. That he could not have been born
at Nazareth is urged by many. Nazareth, it is asserted, did not exist
at this time. Christian scholars admit that there is no proof of its
existence at the beginning of the Christian era outside of the New
Testament. The Encyclopedia Biblica, a leading Christian authority,
says: &ldquo;We cannot perhaps venture to assert positively that there
was a city called Nazareth in Jesus&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matthew and Luke: Because Joseph, who was not his father, but merely
his guardian or foster father, was descended from David.</p>
<p>The Jews expected a Messiah. This expectation was realized, it is
claimed, in Jesus Christ. His Messianic marks, however, were not
discernible and the Jews, for the most part, rejected him. This Messiah
must be a son of David. Before Jesus&rsquo; claims could even be
considered his Davidic descent must be established. This Matthew and
Luke attempt to do. Each gives what purports to be a genealogy of him.
If these genealogies agree they may be false; if they do not agree one
must be false.</p>

<p>From Abraham to David are not fourteen, but thirteen generations;
for David does not belong to this period. The genealogical table of
Matthew naturally and logically comprises three divisions which he
recognizes. The first division comprises the generations preceding the
establishment of the Kingdom of David, beginning with Abraham; the
second comprises the kings of Judah, beginning with David the first and
ending with Jechonias the last; the third comprises the generations

<p>The first three omissions are thus explained by Augustine:
&ldquo;Ochozias [Ahaziah], Joash, and Amazias were excluded from the
number, because their wickedness was continuous and without
interval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if the exclusion of their names from a genealogical list would
expunge their records from history and drain their blood from the veins
of their descendants. But aside from the absurdity of this explanation,
the premises are false. Those whose names are excluded from the list
were not men whose &ldquo;wickedness was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>continuous and without
interval,&rdquo; while some whose names are not excluded were. Ahaziah
reigned but one year. Joash reigned forty years and both Kings and
Chronicles affirm that &ldquo;He did that which was right in the sight
of the Lord&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>Matthew is again guilty of deception. A reference to his table shows
that there were but thirteen generations. In order to carry out his
numerical system of fourteen generations to each period he counts the
generation of Jechonias in this period which he has already counted in
the preceding period; thus performing the mathematical feat of dividing
27 by 2 and obtaining 14 for a quotient.</p>
<p>Had Matthew given a true summary of this genealogy, assuming the
generations from the close of the Old Testament record to Christ to be
correct, instead of these periods of double seven each, we would have
the following: &ldquo;So all the generations from Abraham to David are
thirteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into
Babylon are nineteen generations; and from the carrying away into
Babylon unto Christ are thirteen generations.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Many commentators attempt to reconcile these
discordant genealogies by assuming that Matthew gives the genealogy of
Joseph, while Luke gives the genealogy of Mary. What do the Evangelists
themselves declare? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"
name="pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>Matthew: &ldquo;And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom
was born Jesus, who is called Christ,&rdquo; etc. (<a class=

age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%203:23">iii,
23</a>).</p>
<p>Dr. Geikie, in his &ldquo;Life of Christ&rdquo; (vol. i, p. 531,
note), says: &ldquo;The genealogies given by both Matthew and Luke seem
unquestionably to refer to Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding this the Rev. Dr. McNaught says: &ldquo;Let the reader
bear in mind how Matthew states that &lsquo;Jacob begat Joseph, the
husband of Mary,&rsquo; and how Luke&rsquo;s words are &lsquo;Joseph
which was the son of Heli,&rsquo; and then let him say whether it is
truthful to allege that these different genealogies belong to different
individuals. Is it not plain that each of them professes to trace the
lineal descent of one and the same man, Joseph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Rathbone Greg says: &ldquo;The circumstance that any man
could suppose that Matthew when he said, &lsquo;Jacob begat
Joseph,&rsquo; or Luke, when he said, &lsquo;Joseph was the son of
Heli,&rsquo; could refer to the wife of the one, or the daughter-in-law
of the other, shows to what desperate stratagems polemical orthodoxy
will resort in order to defend an untenable position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo; offers the following
explanation: &ldquo;They are both the genealogies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>of
Joseph, i. e., of Jesus Christ, as the reputed and legal son of Joseph
and Mary. The genealogy of St. Matthew is Joseph&rsquo;s genealogy as
legal successor to the throne of David. St. Luke&rsquo;s is
Joseph&rsquo;s private genealogy, exhibiting his real birth, as
David&rsquo;s son, and thus showing why he was heir to Solomon&rsquo;s
crown. The simple principle that one Evangelist exhibits that genealogy
which contained the successive heirs to David&rsquo;s and
Solomon&rsquo;s throne, while the other exhibits the paternal stem of
him who was the heir, explains all the anomalies of the two
pedigrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This &ldquo;simple principle&rdquo; necessitates three disagreeable
postulates. 1. That the lineage of Nathan, who is not the recorded
possessor of even one wife, survived, while that of Solomon who had
seven hundred wives became extinct. 2. That Joseph was legal successor
to the throne of David, when Heli, his father, was not. 3. That the
first chapter of Matthew contains more than a score of errors. That
little word &ldquo;begat&rdquo; is fatal to the above theory. Matthew
declares that Jacob begat Joseph. If Jacob begat Joseph, then Jacob,
and not Heli, was the father of Joseph. According to Matthew, the royal
line descends from David to Joseph unbroken; each heir begetting the
succeeding one, thus precluding the possibility of a collateral branch
inheriting the throne.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that Jesus was merely the adopted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>son and
legal heir of Joseph and yet fulfilled the Messianic requirements is
untenable. Strauss says: &ldquo;Adoption might indeed suffice to secure
to the adopted son the reversion of certain external family rights and
inheritances; but such a relationship could in no wise lend a claim to
the Messianic dignity, which was attached to the true blood and lineage
of David&rdquo; (<span lang="de">Leben Jesu</span>, p. 122).</p>
<p>The Messiah must be a natural and lineal descendant of David, which
Peter expressly declares Jesus to be: &ldquo;God had sworn with an oath
to him [David], that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh,
he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:30">Acts ii,
30</a>).</p>
<p>It is assumed by some that a Levirate marriage had taken place
between the parents of Joseph, and that the one genealogy belonged to
the natural, the others to the legal father of Joseph. By a Levirate
marriage if a man died without heirs his remaining brother married his
widow and raised up heirs to him. But in this case the brothers would
have the same father, and the genealogies would differ only in the
father of Joseph. It is only by a succession of Levirate marriages and
a juggling of words, which no intelligent critic can seriously
entertain, that such a hypothesis can be considered possible, even
waiving the Old Testament writers, and the Evangelists themselves,
whose language forbids it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eusebius advances an explanation characteristic of this
ecclesiastical historian and of the early church whose history he
professes to record. The Jews, it is said, were divided in their
opinions regarding the descent of the Messiah. While some contended
that his descent must be through the royal line, others believed that
because of the excessive wickedness of the kings the descent would be
through another line. Eusebius says: &ldquo;Matthew gives his opinion,
Luke repeats the common opinion of many, not his own.... This last view
Luke takes, though conscious that Matthew gives the real truth of the
genealogy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy is self-evidently false; while
Luke&rsquo;s according to the admission of the historian of the
primitive church, is merely a fabrication of early Christians, designed
to influence those who rejected Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of the
Messiah.</p>

<p>The second and third passages do not refer to Mary; the first

David.</p>
<p>2. It is stated that Joseph went to Bethlehem &ldquo;to be taxed
with Mary,&rdquo; not because they, but &ldquo;because he was of the
house and lineage of David&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

e., descended from Levi, while the house of David was descended from
Judah.</p>
<p>This desperate, yet ineffectual, effort to establish the Davidic
descent of Mary is virtually an abandonment of the genealogical tables
of Matthew and Luke, and a falling back upon this pitiable argumentum
in circulo: Mary was descended from David because the Messiah was to be
descended from David, and Jesus was the Messiah because Mary was
descended from David.</p>
<p>These genealogies do not give the lineage of Mary who is said to
have been his only earthly parent, but the lineage of Joseph who, it is
claimed, was not his father. But if Joseph was not the father of Jesus,
what is the use of giving his pedigree? If Joseph was not the father of
Jesus how does proving that he was descended from David prove that
Jesus was descended from David? If these genealogies run through Joseph
to Jesus, as stated by Matthew and Luke, then Joseph must have been the
father of Jesus; and if he was the father of Jesus the story of the
miraculous conception is false.</p>
<p>The Synoptics, as we have seen, are for the most part, mere
compilations, made up of preexisting documents. These documents
belonged to different ages of the primitive church. In the first ages
of the church Christians believed that Jesus was simply a man&mdash;the
son of Joseph and Mary. The genealogies of Matthew and Luke, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>trace his descent from David through Joseph,
belonged to this age. The story of the miraculous conception was the
product of a later age.</p>
<p>If the dogma of the miraculous conception be true, if God, and not
Joseph, was the father of Jesus as taught, these genealogies, being
genealogies of Joseph, fail to prove what they are intended to prove,
the royal descent of Jesus from David. The genealogies of Matthew and
Luke and their accounts of the miraculous conception mutually exclude
each other.</p>

<p class="first">The miraculous conception was in fulfillment of what
prophecy?</p>
<p>Matthew: &ldquo;Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin
shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call
his name Emmanuel&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=

<p>This is esteemed the &ldquo;Gem of the Prophecies,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>and may be found in the seventh chapter of Isaiah.
The facts are these: Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel,
had declared war against Ahaz, king of Judah. God assured Ahaz that
they should not succeed, but that their own kingdoms should be
destroyed by the Assyrians. To convince him of the truth of this he
requested Ahaz to demand a sign. &ldquo;But Ahaz said, I will not ask,
neither will I tempt the Lord.... Therefore the Lord himself shall give
you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall
call his name Emmanuel.... Before the child shall know to refuse the
evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be
forsaken of both her kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the succeeding chapter the fulfillment of this prophecy is
recorded: &ldquo;And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and
bare a son. Then said the Lord to me, Call his name
Maher-shalal-hash-baz. For before the child shall have knowledge to
cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus [the capital of
Rezin&rsquo;s kingdom] and the spoils of Samaria [the capital of
Pekah&rsquo;s kingdom] shall be taken away before the king of
Assyria.&rdquo; Rezin and Pekah were overthrown by the Assyrians about
720 B. C.</p>
<p>One of the most convincing proofs of Christ&rsquo;s divinity, with
many, is the supposed fact that he was born of a virgin and that his
miraculous birth was foretold by a prophet seven hundred years before
the event occurred. Now, there is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"

Scriptures declaring that a child should be born of a virgin. The word
translated &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; does not mean a virgin in the accepted
sense of the term, but simply a young woman, either married or single.
The whole passage is a mistranslation. The words rendered &ldquo;a
virgin shall conceive and bear a son&rdquo; should read, &ldquo;a young
woman is with child and beareth a son.&rdquo; In this so-called
prophecy there is not the remotest reference to a miraculous conception
and a virgin-born child. The Jews themselves did not regard this
passage as a Messianic prophecy; neither did they believe that the
Messiah was to be born of a virgin.</p>
<p>Next to the preceding the following is most frequently cited as a
Messianic prophecy: &ldquo;The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, ...
until Shiloh come&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2049:10">Genesis xlix,
10</a>).</p>
<p>If Shiloh refers to Christ the prophecy was not fulfilled, for the
sceptre did depart from Judah 600 years before Christ came. But Shiloh
does not refer to a Messiah, nor to any man. Shiloh was the seat of the
national sanctuary before it was removed to Jerusalem. This so-called
prophecy, like the preceding, is a mistranslation. The correct reading
is as follows: &ldquo;The preeminence shall not depart from Judah so
long as the people resort to Shiloh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto
us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and
his name shall be declared Wonderful, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>Counsellor, The Mighty
God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%209:6">Isaiah ix,
6</a>).</p>
<p>Prof. Cheyne, the highest authority on Isaiah, pronounces this a
forgery. Every honest Christian scholar must admit this. It is a
self-evident forgery. No Jewish writer could have written it. To have
declared even the Messiah to be &ldquo;The mighty God, the everlasting
Father&rdquo; would have been the rankest blasphemy, a crime the
punishment of which was death.</p>
<p>These alleged Messianic prophecies are, in their present form,
Christian rather than Jewish. Christian translators and exegetists have
altered their language and perverted their meaning to make them appear
to refer to Christ. The following is an example:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I will raise unto David a
righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved,
and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be
called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2023:5-6">Jeremiah
xxiii, 5, 6</a>).</p>
<p>The correct rendering of this passage is as follows:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I will raise unto David a
righteous branch, and a king shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
judgment and justice in the land. In his days Judah shall be saved and
Israel shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby they shall
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>call themselves: The Eternal is our
righteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make a Messianic prophecy of this passage and give it effect no
less than eight pieces of deception were employed by the editors of our
Authorized Version:</p>
<p>1. The word &ldquo;branch&rdquo; is made to begin with a capital
letter.</p>
<p>2. The word &ldquo;king&rdquo; also begins with a capital.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;The name&rdquo; is rendered &ldquo;his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. The pronoun &ldquo;they,&rdquo; relating to the people of Judah
and Israel, is changed to &ldquo;he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5. The word &ldquo;Eternal&rdquo; is translated
&ldquo;Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6. &ldquo;The Lord our righteousness&rdquo; is printed in
capitals.</p>
<p>7. In the table of contents, at the head of the chapter, are the
words &ldquo;Christ shall rule and save them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8. At the top of the page are the words &ldquo;Christ
promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another example of this Messianic prophecy making is the
following:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Know therefore and understand that
from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build
Jerusalem, unto Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and three
score and two weeks&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dn%209:25">Daniel ix,
25</a>).</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;week,&rdquo; it is claimed, means a period of seven
years, and assumed that by Messiah is meant Christ. Seven weeks and
three score and two weeks are sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>the time that was to elapse from the command to
rebuild Jerusalem to the coming of Christ, if the prophecy was
fulfilled. The decree of Cyrus to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple was
made 536 B. C. According to the accepted chronology Christ was born 4
B. C. From the decree of Cyrus, then, to the coming of Christ was 532
years instead of 483 years, a period of seven weeks, or forty-nine
years, longer than that named by Daniel. Ezra, the priest, went to
Jerusalem 457 B. C. This event, however, had nothing whatever to do
with the decree for rebuilding Jerusalem and the temple. It occurred 79
years after the decree was issued, and 58 years after the temple was
finished. But a searcher for Messianic prophecies found that from the
time of Ezra to the beginning of Christ&rsquo;s ministry was about 483
years, or sixty-nine prophetic weeks; and notwithstanding there was a
deficiency of 79 years at one end of the period, and an excess of 30
years at the other, it was declared to fit exactly.</p>
<p>Christian theologians pretend to recognize in the Old Testament two
kinds of Messianic prophecies: 1. Specific predictions concerning
Christ which were literally fulfilled; 2. Passages in which the writer
refers to other persons or events, but which God, without the
writer&rsquo;s knowledge, designed as types of Christ. The
fallaciousness of the former having been exposed&mdash;it having been
shown that there is not a text in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>Jewish Scriptures
predicting the coming of Christ&mdash;they now rely chiefly upon the
latter to support their claims. These &ldquo;prophecies&rdquo; are
almost limitless; for a firm believer in prophecy can, with a vivid
imagination, take almost any passage and point out a fancied
resemblance between the thing it refers to and the thing he wants
confirmed; apparently oblivious to the fact that the passage is equally
applicable to a thousand other things. Had the Mormons accepted Joe
Smith as a Messiah instead of a prophet they would have no lack of
prophecies to support their claims; and by translating and revising the
Scriptures to suit their views, as Christians did, these prophecies
would fit him as well as they do the Christ.</p>

<p>No such decree was issued by Augustus, nor even one that the Roman
world should be taxed. The taxation of different provinces of the
empire was made at various times, no general decree ever having been
issued and no uniform assessment ever having been attempted by
Augustus. An enrollment of Roman citizens for the purpose of taxation
was made in Syria 7 A. D.</p>

<p>If Jesus was born during the reign of Herod, Joseph, whether a

<p>Again, this decree could not have applied to Judea prior to the

<p>Even if he had been subject to taxation there was no law or custom
requiring him to leave his own country and go to that of his ancestors
to be enrolled. The assessment, according to the Roman custom, was made
at the residence of the person taxed. Nothing surpasses in absurdity
this story of Luke, that a woman, on the eve of confinement, and the
subject of another ruler, was dragged across two provinces to be
enrolled for taxation.</p>
<p>In regard to this taxation Dr. Hooykaas says: &ldquo;But here again
we are met by overwhelming difficulties. In itself, the
Evangelist&rsquo;s account of the manner in which the census was
carried out is entirely incredible. Only fancy the indescribable
confusion that would have arisen if every one, through the length and
breadth of the land of the Jews, had left his abode to go and enroll
himself in the city or village from which his family originally came,
even supposing he knew where it was. The census under David was
conducted after a very different fashion. But it is still more
important to note that the Evangelist falls into the most extraordinary
mistakes throughout. In the first place history is silent as to a
census of the whole (Roman) world ever having been made at all. In the
next place, though Quirinus [Cyrenius] certainly did make such a
register in Judea and Samaria, it did not extend to Galilee; so that
Joseph&rsquo;s household was not affected by it. Besides <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>it
did not take place till ten years after the death of Herod, when his
son Archelaus was deposed by the Emperor, and the districts of Judea
and Samaria were thrown into a Roman province. Under the reign of Herod
nothing of the kind took place, nor was there any occasion for it.
Finally, at the time of the birth of Jesus the governor of Syria was
not Quirinus, but Quintus Sentius Saturninus&rdquo; (Bible for
Learners, vol. iii, pp. 55, 56).</p>

<p>Nothing can be clearer than that the author of Matthew supposes that

while that of Matthew has been ignored.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s birth in a manger and death on the cross are the
lodestones that have attracted the sympathies of the world, and kept
him on the throne of Christendom; for sentiment rather than reason
dominates mankind. Referring to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108"

significant of all the legends of the Bible. That it is a legend,
without even the smallest historical foundation, we must, of course,
admit&rdquo; (vol. iii, p. 54).</p>
<p>Justin Martyr states that Jesus was born in a cave, and this
statement Farrar is disposed to accept: &ldquo;Justin Martyr, the
Apologist, who, from his birth at Shechem, was familiar with Palestine,
and who lived less than a century after the time of our Lord, places
the scene of the nativity in a cave. This is, indeed, the ancient and
constant tradition both of the Eastern and the Western churches, and it
is one of the few to which, though unrecorded in the Gospel history, we
may attach a reasonable probability&rdquo; (Life of Christ, p. 3).</p>

<p>According to Luke the visit of the angels is to proclaim to the

reported by this Evangelist really occurred the news of it would have
quickly spread over Palestine. Yet the people of Jerusalem, only a few

who visit him at a much later period. The inhabitants of Bethlehem
themselves are ignorant of it. Could they have discovered to Herod this
wonderful babe, or the place where his parents abode while there if
they had departed, it would have saved their own children from

16</a>).</p>
<p>If this statement be true hundreds of innocent babes (the Greek
Calendar says fourteen thousand) must have perished, a crime the
enormity of which is almost without a parallel in the annals of
history. It is strange that Mark, Luke, and John make no mention of
this frightful tragedy. Luke&rsquo;s silence is especially significant.
It is passing strange that the Roman historians and Rabbinical writers
of that age, who wrote of Herod, should be silent regarding it.
Josephus devotes nearly forty chapters to the life of Herod. He
narrates with much particularity every important event in his life. He
detested this monarch and dwells upon his crimes and errors. Yet
Josephus knew nothing of this massacre.</p>
<p>In this silence of Josephus Dr. Farrar recognizes a difficulty too
damaging to ignore. He says: &ldquo;Why then, it has been asked, does
Josephus make no mention of so infamous an atrocity? Perhaps because it
was performed so secretly that he did not even know of it. Perhaps
because, in those terrible days, the murder of a score of children, in
consequence of a transient suspicion, would have been regarded as an
item utterly insignificant in the list of Herod&rsquo;s murders.
Perhaps because it was passed over in silence by Nikolaus of Damascus,
who, writing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>in the true spirit of those Hellenizing
courtiers, who wanted to make a political Messiah out of a corrupt and
blood-stained usurper, magnified all his patron&rsquo;s achievements,
and concealed or palliated all his crimes. But the more probable reason
is that Josephus, whom, in spite of all the immense literary debt which
we owe to him, we can only regard as a renegade and a sycophant, did
not choose to make any allusion to facts which were even remotely
connected with the life of Christ&rdquo; (Life of Christ, pp. 22,
23).</p>
<p>A more absurd reason than the first advanced by Farrar it is
difficult to conceive. The second, that it was a matter of too little
consequence to record, an explanation which other Christian apologists
have assigned, is as unreasonable as it is heartless. The silence of
Nikolaus, who wrote of Herod after his death, is also significant, and
the excuse offered by Farrar that he omitted it because he was the
friend of Herod, even if admitted, cannot apply to Josephus, who
abhorred the memory of this monarch. The contention that Josephus
purposely ignored the existence of Christ because he saw in him a
menace to his faith is childish. Jesus Christ, admitting his existence,
had made no history to record. His birth was attended by no prodigies,
and there was nothing in his advent to excite the fear or envy of a
king. Josephus mentions no Herodian massacre at Bethlehem <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>because none occurred. Had Herod slain a single
child in the manner stated the fact would be attested by a score of
authors whose writings are extant. Herod did not slay one babe. This
story is false.</p>
<p>Herod&rsquo;s massacre of the infants of Bethlehem and the escape of
Jesus was probably suggested by Kansa&rsquo;s massacre of the infants
of Matura and the escape of Krishna. Pharaoh&rsquo;s slaughter of the
first born in Egypt may also have suggested it.</p>

<p>Regarding this subject, Dr. Geikie writes as follows: &ldquo;The age
of Jesus at his entrance on his public work has been variously
estimated. Ewald supposes that he was about thirty-four, fixing his
birth three years before the death of Herod. Wieseler, on the contrary,
believes him to have been in his thirty-first year, setting his birth a
few months before Herod&rsquo;s death. Bunsen, Anger, Winer, Schurer,
and Renan agree with this. Lichtenstein makes him thirty-two. Hausrath
and Keim, on the other hand, think that he began his ministry in the
year A. D. 34, but they do not give any supposed date for his birth,
though if that of Ewald <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>be taken as a medium he must have
been forty years old, while, if Wieseler&rsquo;s date be preferred, he
would only have been thirty-seven.... Amidst such difference, exactness
is impossible&rdquo; (Life of Christ, vol. i, pp. 455, 456).</p>

<p>John, if the account in Josephus is to be credited, made some
converts; but all the inhabitants of Judea were not baptized by
him.</p>
<p>Is John the Baptist a historical character? Aside from the anonymous
and apocryphal writings of the church, which appeared in the second
century, the only evidence of his existence is a passage in Josephus
(Antiquities, B. xviii, ch. v, sec. 2). The language of this passage,
while not avowedly Christian like the passage pertaining to Christ, is
yet of such a character as to excite suspicion regarding its
genuineness. Its position strongly suggests an interpolation. Josephus
gives an account of the troubles that arose between Herod Antipas,
tetrarch of Galilee, and Aretas, king of Arabia Petrea. Herod had
married the daughter of Aretas; but becoming infatuated with Herodias,
his sister-in-law, he resolved to put her away and marry Herodias.
Discovering his intentions his wife obtained permission to visit her
father, who when he had been informed of Herod&rsquo;s perfidy, made
war upon him and defeated him in battle. Herod appealed to the Emperor
Tiberius, who was his friend, and who ordered Vitellius, governor of
Syria, to invade the dominions of Aretas and capture or slay him. I
quote the concluding portion of section 1 and the opening sentence of
section 3 of the chapter containing this history, separating the two
with an ellipsis:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So Herod wrote about these affairs
to Tiberius, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>who, being very angry at the attempt made by
Aretas, wrote to Vitellius to make war upon him, and either to take him
alive, and bring him in bonds, or to kill him, and send him his head.
This was the charge that Tiberius gave to the president of Syria.... So
Vitellius prepared to make war with Aretas, having with him two legions
of armed men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the writer were to declare that Washington and Monroe were
presidents of the United States at the same time it would be no more
erroneous than the declaration of Luke that Annas and Caiaphas were
high priests at the same time. Two priests never held this office
jointly. Caiaphas was high priest at this time, and three others had
held the office previous to him and subsequent to Annas. Referring to
Pontius Pilate&rsquo;s predecessor, Gratus, who was procurator of Judea
from 15 to 26 A. D., Josephus says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This man deprived Ananus [Annas]
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=

of Phabi, to be high priest. He also deprived him in a little time, and
ordained Eleazer, the son of Ananus, who had been high priest before,
to be high priest; which office, when he had held for a year, Gratus
deprived him of it, and gave the high priesthood to Simon, the son of
Camithus, and, when he had possessed the dignity no longer than a year,
Joseph Caiaphas was made his successor&rdquo; (Antiquities B. xviii,

<p>Concerning this discrepancy, Farrar says: &ldquo;The order of the

Matthew placing second the scene on the pinnacle of the temple, and St.
Luke the vision of the kingdoms of the world. Both orders cannot be
right&rdquo; (Life of Christ, p. 70).</p>
<p>Some of the ablest Christian scholars have refused to accept the
Temptation as historical. Farrar says: &ldquo;From Origen down to
Schleiermacher some have regarded it as a vision or allegory&mdash;the
symbolic description of a purely inward struggle; and even so literal a
commentator <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=

<p class="first">To what city did John belong, and where was it

<p>John: &ldquo;Bethsaida of Galilee&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%205:10">Luke v,
10</a>), they must have belonged to the same city. But Bethsaida was
not in Galilee, but in Gaulonitis. Hence if John wrote the Gospel
ascribed to him, he did not know the location of his own city.</p>
<p>It is remarkable with what ease theologians harmonize the most
discordant statements. In this case the only thing required was, in
drawing the map of Palestine, to make two dots instead of one and write
the word Bethsaida twice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=

<p>From the Synoptics the conclusion is inevitable that if there was
one disciple whom Jesus esteemed higher than the others it was Peter
whom he is declared to have chosen for the head of his church. John, on
the other hand, assuming that he wrote the Fourth Gospel, as claimed,
takes frequent occasion to impress us with the idea that he was the
bright particular star in the Apostolic galaxy. Four times (<a class=

<p>If John wrote the Fourth Gospel this self-glorification proves him

forgery. The first assumption, if correct, impairs its credibility; the

the land of Zebulon, and the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more

<p>Matthew both misquotes and misapplies this passage. He eliminates
the facts and alters the language to make a Messianic prophecy. The
words were not intended as a prophecy. The events mentioned by Isaiah
had occurred when he wrote. The &ldquo;great light,&rdquo; which they

<p class="first">Where did Jesus deliver his so-called Sermon on the
Mount?</p>
<p>Matthew: &ldquo;He went up into a mountain&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>Luke: &ldquo;He came down with them, and stood in the plain&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%206:17">vi,
17</a>).</p>
<p>Both Matthew and Luke represent him as being on a mountain; but
while Matthew has him go up into the mountain to deliver his sermon,
Luke has him come down out of the mountain to deliver it.</p>
<p>In regard to this discrepancy, the Dutch theologian, Dr. Hooykaas,
says: &ldquo;The Evangelist [Matthew] had a special motive for fixing
upon a mountain for this purpose. He intended to represent Jesus laying
down the fundamental laws of the kingdom of heaven as the counterpart
of Moses who promulgated the constitution of the Old Covenant from
Mount Sinai. Luke, on the other hand, not wishing Jesus to be regarded
as a second Moses, or another lawgiver, just as deliberately makes the
Master <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=

<p>The agreements between the two versions of this sermon, of which the
foregoing are a part, are ample to prove them to be reports of the same
discourse; while the variations are certainly sufficient to disprove
the infallibility of the evangelistic reporters.</p>
<p>Whether it be historical or fabricated&mdash;whether Jesus delivered
the sermon or not&mdash;Matthew and Luke have given merely different
versions of the same composition. The exordiums are the same; the
perorations are the same&mdash;both end with the illustration of the
men, one of whom built his house on a frail, the other on a firm
foundation; the doctrines enunciated are substantially the same; while
the words in which they are clothed proclaim a common origin.
Matthew&rsquo;s version is longer than Luke&rsquo;s; either Matthew has
added to, or Luke has taken from the original report of the sermon.</p>

<p>The commonly accepted version of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer is the
Authorized Version of Matthew. This version is admitted to be grossly
inaccurate. It contains sixty-six words. The Revised Version of Matthew
contains but fifty-five. Twenty-four words either do not belong to the
prayer, or have been misplaced; while words which do belong to it have
been omitted. If the custodians of the Christian Scriptures have
permitted the prayer of their Lord to be corrupted to this extent, what
reliance can be placed upon the genuineness of the remainder of these
writings?</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, like so many more of the precepts and
discourses ascribed to Jesus, is borrowed. Dr. Hardwicke, of England,
says: &ldquo;The so-called &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;s Prayer&rsquo; was
learned by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>Messiah as the &lsquo;Kadish&rsquo; from the
Talmud.&rdquo; The Kadish, as translated by a Christian scholar, Rev.
John Gregorie, is as follows:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Our Father which art in heaven, be
gracious to us, O Lord, our God; hallowed be thy name, and let the
remembrance of thee be glorified in heaven above and in the earth here
below. Let thy kingdom reign over us now and forever. The holy men of
old said, Remit and forgive unto all men whatsoever they have done
against me. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the
evil thing. For thine is the kingdom, and thou shalt reign in glory for
ever and for evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eminent Swiss theologian, Dr. Wetstein, says: &ldquo;It is a
curious fact that the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer may be constructed almost
verbatim out of the Talmud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sermon on the Mount is derived largely from the teachings of the
Essenes, a Jewish sect to which Jesus is believed by many to have
belonged.</p>

<p>It is generally conceded by orthodox critics that it occurred
neither in the country of the Gergesenes nor in the country of the
Gadarenes, but in the country of the Gerasenes. It could not have
occurred in the country of the Gadarenes because it is said to have
occurred on the sea shore and Gadara was situated several miles from
the sea.</p>
<p>Voltaire says the story is disproved by the fact that the event is
alleged to have taken place in a country where no swine were kept.</p>

the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
And when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her, and said unto her,
Weep not. And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him
stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. And he
that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his

<p>The other Evangelists were certainly ignorant of this miracle; for
if they had known of it they could not have omitted it, as it is the
most important miracle related by a Synoptist, and, with one exception,
the most important of all Christ&rsquo;s miracles.</p>
<p>A miracle almost identical with this is related of Apollonius.
Referring to the two, Baur says: &ldquo;As according to Luke, it was a
young man, the only son of a widow, who was being carried out of the
city; so, in Philostratus, it is a young maiden already betrothed,
whose bier Apollonius meets. The command to set down the bier, the mere
touch, and a few words, are sufficient here, as there, to bring the
dead to life&rdquo; (Apollonius of Tyana and Christ, p. 145).</p>

According to Matthew the Galileans rejected him; according to John
&ldquo;the Galileans received him.&rdquo; According to Matthew, Galilee
was &ldquo;his own country&rdquo;; according to John, Judea was
&ldquo;his own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding these contradictory statements, Scott, in his
&ldquo;English Life of Jesus&rdquo; (p. 114), says: &ldquo;The
Synoptists in every case give a special reason for his leaving Galilee,
while the fourth gospel is equally careful in specifying the reason for
his leaving Jerusalem. According to the former, Jesus would not have
left Galilee if he could have avoided it; according to the latter, he
would have remained at Jerusalem if he could have done so with safety.
The inconsistency is glaring.&rdquo;</p>

would ask. And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give

<p>This account of the death of John is utterly at variance with that
given in Josephus. This historian, assuming the passage relating to
John to be genuine, says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Herod, who feared lest the great
influence John had over the people might put it into his power and
inclination to raise rebellion (for they seemed to do anything he
should advise), thought it best by putting him to death, to prevent any
mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by
sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it should be too
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of
Herod&rsquo;s suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I before
mentioned, and was there put to death&rdquo; (Antiquities, B. xviii,
ch. v, sec. 2).</p>
<p>Macherus, where Josephus states that John was executed, was a place
far removed from Herod&rsquo;s capital&mdash;was outside of his
dominions&mdash;in Arabia Petrea.</p>
<p>Referring to the Evangelistic account of John&rsquo;s death, Dr.
Hooykaas says: &ldquo;This eminently dramatic story certainly cannot be
accepted as it stands. It betrays too much art in its striking
contrasts between the manners of the court and the person of the
prophet. We have already seen that the occasion of John&rsquo;s
imprisonment is not correctly given by the Gospels. That such a man as
Herod &lsquo;delighted in hearing&rsquo; John is, to say the least, an
exaggeration. The ghastly scene in which the prophet&rsquo;s head is
carried into the festive hall may not be quite impossible in such an
age and at such a court, but it is hardly probable. It is easy to see
that Herodias is drawn after the model of Ahab&rsquo;s wife, who hated
and persecuted the first Elijah; and Salome is evidently copied from
Esther, for she, too, visits the prince by surprise, captivates him by
her beauty, obtains a promise of anything up to the half of his
kingdom, and at the festive board demands the death of her enemy as the
royal boon&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, vol. iii, p. 272). <span class=

<p>Herodias was a grand-daughter of Herod the Great, and married her
uncle Herod, the disinherited son of Herod the Great. She subsequently
married Antipas, the Herod who is said to have put John to death.
Herod&rsquo;s brother Philip (Tetrarch of Trachonitis and Gaulonitis)
was not the son of Marianne, as the first husband of Herodias was, but
the son of Cleopatra. Philip&rsquo;s wife was Salome, the daughter of
Herodias. The daughter of Herodias, instead of being a damsel dancing
at the court of Herod, as the Synoptics declare, was at this time the
wife of an aged ruler of a foreign province. According to Whiston, she
became a widow in the very year in which John died. Herodias was not
the wife, but the mother-in-law of Herod&rsquo;s brother Philip.
Whiston, in his translation of Josephus, attempts to gloss over the
Synoptics&rsquo; error by inserting in brackets after Herod the word
&ldquo;Philip.&rdquo; Scribners&rsquo; &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo;
concedes the error and accounts for it &ldquo;By supposing that there
is a confusion between the first husband and the son-in-law of
Herodias, for her daughter Salome married Philip the
tetrarch.&rdquo;</p>

intention of feeding the four thousand?</p>
<p>Mark: &ldquo;And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man

<p>Why should they be surprised at his intention of feeding four
thousand with seven loaves when but a few weeks before he had fed five
thousand with five loaves?</p>
<p>In regard to this miracle Rev. William Sanday, of England, author of
&ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo; the most important article in
Scribners&rsquo; &ldquo;Bible Dictionary,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Are the
two Feedings of Mark to be regarded as two events or one? Besides the
general resemblance between the two narratives, a weighty argument in
favor of the latter hypothesis is, that in the second narrative the
disciples&rsquo; question implies that the emergency was something new.
They could hardly have put this question as they did if a similar event
had happened only a few weeks before.&rdquo; This is also the opinion
of Dr. Schleiermacher. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=

<p>It is remarkable that Matthew, Mark and Luke, who did not witness
the Transfiguration, are the only ones to report it; while John, who is
declared to have witnessed it, knows nothing about it. Concerning this
and other events which John is said to have witnessed, Greg says:
&ldquo;All the events said to have been witnessed by John alone are
omitted by John alone. This fact seems fatal either to the reality of
the events in question or to the genuineness of the Fourth
Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding this subject Scott says: &ldquo;By some singular fatality
the writer of the fourth gospel seems incapable of describing any one
incident in the life of Jesus as the Synoptics have described it.... It
is hard to believe that we are reading narratives which profess to
relate the life of the same person.... If then in these particulars,
the Synoptic Gospels are correct, the Johannine version of the events
is pure fiction; and if the latter be taken as the true account,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=

<p class="first">What was the nature of the tribute demanded?</p>
<p>It was an annual tax, known as the temple service tax, a tax from
which no Jew, rich or poor, was exempt. Regarding the time and manner
of its collection, Farrar says: &ldquo;On the 1st of Adar, the demand
was made quietly and civilly; if, however, it had not been paid by the
25th, then it seems that the collectors of the contribution (tobhin
shekalim) might take a security for it from the defaulter&rdquo; (Life
of Christ, p. 285).</p>
<p>The tax was always collected in the early spring. Yet according to
Matthew it was collected from Jesus in the autumn, just before the
feast of tabernacles. Either Matthew was ignorant of the time of its
collection, or Jesus was a defaulter.</p>
<p>Nor is this the only difficulty needing explanation. It is assumed
that Peter secured the coin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href=
"#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>in the manner directed. If so, how
did it come into existence? Did Jesus miraculously create it? If so, he
was a counterfeiter. Was it a lost coin? In this case, if he was
omniscient, as claimed, he knew the owner and should have restored
it.</p>

<p>Two entirely different routes. As the province of Samaria lay
between those of Galilee and Judea, the direct route from Galilee to
Jerusalem was &ldquo;through the midst of Samaria.&rdquo; The orthodox
Jews, however, in order to avoid the Samaritans, whom they thoroughly
despised, usually crossed the Jordan, which formed the boundary of the
three provinces, came down on the east side of the river through Perea,
recrossed the river, and thus entered &ldquo;into the coasts of Judea
from the farther side of Jordan.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The Synoptics make no mention of this miracle; and as it is the
greatest miracle ascribed to Jesus it was certainly unknown to
them.</p>
<p>Commenting on the doubtful character of alleged events narrated by
one Evangelist and omitted by the others, Strauss says: &ldquo;But this
ground of doubt falls with incomparably greater weight, on the
narrative of the resurrection of Lazarus in the fourth gospel. If the
authors or collectors of the three first gospels knew of this, they
could not, for more than one reason, avoid introducing it into their
writings. For, first, of all the resuscitations effected by Jesus, nay,
of all his miracles, this resurrection of Lazarus, if not the most
wonderful, is yet the one in which the marvelous presents itself the
most obviously and strikingly, and which, therefore, if its historical
reality can be established, is a preeminently strong proof of the
extraordinary endowments of Jesus as a divine messenger; whence the
evangelists, although they had related one or two other instances of
the kind, could not think it superfluous to add this also. But,
secondly, the resurrection of Lazarus had, according to the
representation of John, a direct influence in the development of the
fate of Jesus; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>for we learn from xi, 47 ff., that the increased
resort to Jesus, and the credit which this event procured him, led to
that consultation of the Sanhedrim in which the sanguinary counsel of
Caiaphas was given and approved. Thus the event had a double
importance&mdash;pragmatical as well as dogmatical; consequently, the
synoptical writers could not have failed to narrate it, had it been
within their knowledge&rdquo; (<span lang="de">Leben Jesu</span>, p.
548).</p>
<p>Referring to this miracle and the restoration of the sight of the
man born blind, Prof. Newman says: &ldquo;That the three first
narrators should have been ignorant of them is simply impossible; that
they should not have felt their preeminent value is incredible&rdquo;
(Religion not History, p. 27).</p>
<p>There are three alleged instances in the Gospels of Christ restoring
the dead to life.</p>
<p>1. The raising of the daughter of Jairus from her death bed, related
by Matthew.</p>
<p>2. The raising of the son of the widow of Nain from his bier as they
were carrying him to the grave, related by Luke.</p>
<p>3. The raising of Lazarus from his grave after he had lain four
days, related by John.</p>
<p>Even if these miracles were possible one fact disproves them: the
silence of the other Evangelists. Of these three stories not one is
confirmed by another Evangelist. His less important miracles, such as
healing the sick, are, many of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"
href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>them, recorded in all of the
gospels, or at least in all of the Synoptics; yet each of these, his
greatest miracles, stands alone, unnoticed by the other writers. Mark
and Luke mention the daughter of Jairus, but only to deny the miracle
by declaring that she was not dead. Had these miracles really been
performed, all of the Evangelists would have had a knowledge of them,
and all would have recorded them. These writers do not complement each
other, as claimed: they exclude each other. There are many Lives of
Napoleon; but not one of his biographers has seen fit to omit his
greatest victories because some other biographer has narrated them.</p>

"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zec%209:9">Zechariah ix,
9</a>) arises from a misunderstanding of the meaning of its words. The
prophet, or poet, does not mean two asses, but one; the clause &ldquo;a
colt the foal of an ass,&rdquo; is merely a poetical repetition or
qualification of the preceding clause.</p>
<p>This blunder of Matthew is significant. It exposes the fictitious
character of this so-called Gospel history. It proves that
Christ&rsquo;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem is not a historical
event&mdash;that this story is a pure fabrication, suggested by this
alleged prophecy.</p>

&ldquo;Zacharias son of Barachias&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2023:35">xxiii,
35</a>).</p>
<p>The Zacharias mentioned was slain in Jerusalem, 69 A. D.; so that
Matthew makes Jesus refer to an event that occurred forty years after
his death.</p>
<p>Referring to this passage, the Catholic scholar, Dr. Hug, says:
&ldquo;There cannot be a doubt, if we attend to the name, the fact and
its circumstances, and the object of Jesus in citing it, that it was
the same Zacharias Barouchos, who, according to Josephus, a short time
before the destruction of Jerusalem, was unjustly slain in the
temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commenting on this passage, Prof. Newman says: &ldquo;There is no
other man known in history to whom the verse can allude. If so, it
shows how late, how ignorant, how rash, is the composer of a text
passed off on us as sacred truth&rdquo; (Religion not History, p.
46).</p>

<p>Where was he when he uttered this lamentation?</p>
<p>Matthew: During his visit at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Luke: In Galilee before he went to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Not only are these writers at variance with each other as to the
time and place of utterance, but the lamentation itself, which declares
that he had made repeated efforts to convert Jerusalem, is at variance
with both of them. For according to Matthew he had just arrived on his

<p>These different versions of the anointing of Jesus present so many
discrepancies that some have supposed that two or more anointings were
made. The Archbishop of York, the most popular of Gospel harmonists,
concedes that but one anointing was made.</p>
<p>After an exhaustive review of the case, Strauss says: &ldquo;Without
doubt, we have here but one history under three various forms; and this
seems to have been the real conclusion of Origen, as well as recently
of Schleiermacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">While Jesus was at Jerusalem there came a voice from
heaven. For what purpose was the voice sent?</p>
<p>John: For the sake of those who stood by. <span class=

<p>Of what benefit was the voice when those who heard it were unable to

<p>The Evangelists relate several instances of celestial voices being
heard. As there is, in nearly every instance, a disagreement in regard
to the message conveyed, it is probable that an electrical disturbance
inspired the voice, while a vivid imagination interpreted its
meaning<span class="corr" id="xd21e6328" title="Not in source">.</span>
Regarding these voices, the Duke of Somerset says: &ldquo;A belief in
these heavenly voices was a common superstition among the

<p>John: On the day preceding the Passover.</p>
<p>Luke says: &ldquo;And they made ready the passover. And when the
hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. And he
said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with
you before I suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John, in his account of the Last Supper, says it was &ldquo;before
the feast of the passover&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2013:1">xiii, 1</a>).
The Evangelists all agree that his trial and execution took place on
the day following the Last Supper. John says the Jews &ldquo;went not
into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>that
they might eat the passover&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2018:28">xviii,
28</a>). After narrating the events of the trial, John says: &ldquo;And
it was the preparation of the passover&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2019:14">xix,
14</a>).</p>
<p>According to the Synoptics, the Last Supper was eaten on the 14th
Nisan, and, by our mode of reckoning time, on Thursday evening;
according to John, it was eaten on the 13th Nisan, and, by our mode of
reckoning, on Wednesday evening. The Synoptics declare that this supper
was the regular Paschal meal; according to John, it was an ordinary
meal, the Paschal meal not being eaten until after Christ&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Synoptics represent most
clearly that Jesus on the evening of the 14th Nisan, after the custom
of the Jews, ate the Passover with his disciples, and that he was
arrested in the first hours of the 15th Nisan, the day on which he was
put to death. Nothing can be more distinct than the statement that the
last supper was the Paschal feast.... The fourth Gospel, however, in
accordance with the principle which is dominant throughout, represents
the last repast which Jesus eats with his disciples as a common supper,
which takes place, not on the 14th, but on the 13th Nisan, the day
&lsquo;before the feast of the
Passover.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Supernatural Religion.</p>
<p>Thousands of pages have been written in vain attempts to reconcile
this grave discrepancy. Scribner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible
Dictionary,&rdquo; which contains the best fruits of orthodox
scholarship, both of England <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>and America, concedes a
contradiction. It says: &ldquo;The Synoptics seem to identify the two
[the Last Supper and the Paschal meal], whereas St. John expressly
places the Last Supper before the Passover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an exhaustive review of the subject, Strauss voices the
conclusion of German scholars in the following words: &ldquo;Our only
course is to acknowledge an irreconcilable contradiction between the
respective accounts, without venturing a decision as to which is the
correct one&rdquo; (<span lang="de">Leben Jesu</span>, p. 702).</p>

<p class="first">The Synoptics state that the Last Supper was the
Paschal meal. Describe the Paschal meal.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All leaning upon the cushions
around the table, the first cup of wine was served, and grace
pronounced over the same and the feast. This cup of wine being disposed
of, vegetables and sauce were placed on the table, and the vegetables,
dipped in the sauce, were blessed and eaten. Next the unleavened bread,
the bitter herb, and a piquant sauce called Haroseth were served, and
the bitter herb, dipped in the Haroseth, was blessed and eaten. Then
the Paschal lamb was placed on the table with portions of another
sacrifice. One of the company asked the question why all this was done,
during which the second cup of wine was served. The head of the table
explaining narrated the story of the Exodus, closed with a hymn, spoke
the second <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>time grace over the wine, and all disposed of
the same. Now came the breaking of the bread and the eating and
drinking. This finished, the third cup of wine was served, and grace
after meal was pronounced. After which the fourth cup was served, and
the ceremonies closed with hymns and psalms, and disposing of the
fourth cup of wine&rdquo; (Mishna).</p>
<p>This was the Paschal meal as it was observed in the reputed time of
Christ and up to 70 A. D. After the fall of Jerusalem and the
destruction of the temple the great Passover feast retained but the
shadow of its former glory. The Paschal meal and the ceremonies
attending it were generally shortened. The fact that the Evangelists
were unacquainted with the regular Paschal meal, that the Synoptics
were familiar only with the ceremonies of later times, shows that the
Last Supper is a myth, and the Gospels the products of a later age.</p>
<p>Criticising the Synoptics&rsquo; accounts of the Paschal meal, Dr.
Isaac Wise, an able Jewish scholar, says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If any evidence is required that
neither Mark nor Matthew had ever seen the Paschal meal, or described
that of Jesus, it is furnished here. They do not mention any one point
connected with the Paschal supper, the ceremonies of which were
established. They mention only one ceremony, viz., the breaking of the
bread, and the cup of wine after the meal, which is not only a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>mistake, but shows conclusively, that either of
them had seen the Paschal supper, after the destruction of Jerusalem,
in some Jewish house, and the ceremonies connected therewith, called
the Seder. Therefore, no mention whatsoever is made of the main
thing&mdash;the Paschal lamb&mdash;and the bread is broken after the
meal, which was done by the Jews after closing the Paschal meal,
outside of Jerusalem, when the altar had been destroyed; and no Paschal
lamb was eaten&rdquo; (Martyrdom of Jesus, pp. 36, 37).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Luke begins correctly, but makes a
mistake in having the bread broken right after the first cup of wine
was handed round, which was done so at every festive meal, except at
the one described, and has but two cups of wine instead of four. So we
know that Luke did not describe what actually happened that evening. He
had seen the Jewish custom of opening the festive meals with grace over
the wine and bread, and made of it an introduction to the Last Supper,
without knowing that just that evening the custom was changed&rdquo;
(Ibid. p. 38).</p>

<p>According to the Synoptics nearly his entire ministry was confined

his death, that he visited Judea to attend the Passover. According to
John his ministry was confined chiefly to Judea. It requires but three
or four of his twenty-one chapters to record his work in Galilee.

<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They however, that they may
establish their false opinion regarding that which is written,
&lsquo;To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,&rsquo; maintain
that he preached for one year only, and then suffered in the twelfth
month. They are forgetful of their own disadvantage, destroying his
whole work, and robbing him of that age which is both more necessary
and more honorable than any other; that more advanced age, I mean,
during which also, as a teacher, he excelled all others. For how could
he have had disciples if he did not teach? And how could he have
taught, unless he had reached the age of a master? For when he came to
be baptized, he had not yet completed his thirtieth year, but was
beginning to be about thirty years of age.... Now, that the first stage
of early life embraces thirty years, and that this extends onward to
the fortieth year, every one will admit; but from the fortieth and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>fiftieth year, a man begins to decline toward
old age; which our Lord possessed, while he still fulfilled the office
of a teacher.... He did not therefore preach for only one year, nor did
he suffer in the twelfth month of the year. For the period included
between the thirtieth and fiftieth year can never be regarded as one
year&rdquo; (Book ii, ch. xxii, secs. 5, 6).</p>

<p class="first">Can the alleged teachings of Jesus be accepted as
authentic?</p>
<p>Three facts disprove, for the most part, their authenticity.</p>
<p>1. The most important teachings ascribed to him by the Synoptics
were borrowed, either by him or his biographers, from other teachers
and writers.</p>
<p>2. His teachings as presented by the Synoptics, and as presented by
John, exclude each other. No critic can seriously contend that the
discourses and sayings of Jesus recorded in the Synoptics and those
given in the Fourth Gospel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>emanated from the same mind. They
are wholly dissimilar, both in doctrine and phraseology. Dr. Westcott
says: &ldquo;It is impossible to pass from the Synoptic Gospels to that
of St. John without feeling that the transition involves the passage
from one world of thought to another. No familiarity with the general
teaching of the Gospels, no wide conception of the character of the
Savior, is sufficient to destroy the contrast which exists in form and
spirit between the earlier and later narratives&rdquo; (Introduction to
Study of Gospels, p. 249).</p>
<p>3. The discourses attributed to Jesus in the Fourth Gospel were
evidently composed by the author of that Gospel. This is apparent to
every careful reader.</p>
<p>The teachings ascribed to Jesus in John, then, are spurious; while
those ascribed to him in Matthew, Mark and Luke are of doubtful
authenticity. If any of the teachings of Jesus have been preserved they
exist in the first three Gospels, but the unauthentic character of the
Gospels themselves, renders it impossible to ascribe to him with
certainty a single teaching. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=

<p class="first">The purchase of the potter&rsquo;s field was in
fulfillment of what prophecy?</p>
<p>Matthew: &ldquo;That which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was
valued, ... and gave them for the potter&rsquo;s field, as the Lord
appointed me&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

id="xd21e6763" title="Source: .">,</span> 9, 10</a>).</p>
<p>This was not spoken by Jeremiah, but by Zechariah. &ldquo;And the
Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was
prized at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them
to the potter in the house of the Lord&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zeh%2011:13">xi,
13</a>).</p>
<p>It is evident that the account of the betrayal was inspired, not by
a historical fact, but by a desire to &ldquo;fulfill&rdquo; a Messianic
prophecy. Zechariah did not predict an event, but his words did suggest
a fiction. This is the more probable from the fact that Matthew is the
only Evangelist who mentions the thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>The story of Christ&rsquo;s last visit to Jerusalem and the story of
his betrayal exclude each other. According to the Evangelists he was
not arrested for any offense he had committed during this visit, but
for offenses he had committed prior to this. Yet during this visit he
is said to have appeared openly with his disciples, making a triumphal
entry into the city, visiting the temple and teaching in public. In the
face of this the story that the Jews were obliged to bribe one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>of his disciples in order to apprehend him is
absurd. One of these stories must be false. Regarding them Lord
Amberley observes: &ldquo;The representation of the Gospels, that Jesus
went on teaching in public to the very end of his career, and yet that
Judas received a bribe for his betrayal, is self-contradictory&rdquo;
(Life of Jesus, p. 214).</p>
<p>To those who believe the accounts of the betrayal of Jesus to be
historical, the ecclesiastical historian, Neander, in his &ldquo;Life
of Christ,&rdquo; advances a suggestion that is worthy of
consideration. The betrayal of Jesus by Judas, it is suggested, was
intended as a test of his <span class="corr" id="xd21e6780" title=
"Source: Messiaship">Messiahship</span>. If Jesus was the Messiah,
Judas reasoned, he could save himself; if he was not the Messiah he was
an impostor and deserved death.</p>

<p>Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, one of the chief Christian authorities
of the second century, and who wrote before the books of Matthew and
Acts were written, gives the following account of the fate of
Judas:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Judas walked about in the world a
great example of impiety; for his body having swollen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>so
that, on an occasion, when a wagon was moving on its way, he could not
pass it, he was crushed by the chariot and his bowels gushed
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The German commentator, Dr. Hase, attempts to reconcile his suicide,
as related by Matthew, with his death by accident, as related by Peter,
by supposing that he attempted to hang himself, but that the rope
broke, causing him to fall with such force as to disembowel himself.
This harmonist apparently forgets to note that Peter says he fell
&ldquo;headlong,&rdquo; which makes it necessary to suppose that he
hung himself by the feet.</p>

<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Annas therefore sent him bound

<p>This verse follows the account of Jesus&rsquo; preliminary

Annas, and that he was not sent to Caiaphas until its conclusion. The
King James translators, in order to hide the discrepancy, prefixed the
word &ldquo;now&rdquo; and changed the tense of the verb, substituting
&ldquo;had sent&rdquo; for &ldquo;sent,&rdquo; so that it might appear
that Annas had sent him to Caiaphas before the examination
commenced.</p>
<p>Concerning this corruption of the text, Scott says: &ldquo;There is
no conjunction &lsquo;now,&rsquo; and an aorist cannot mark a definite

who is declared to be the author of Acts, says that Annas and Caiaphas
were both high priests.</p>
<p>Criticizing John&rsquo;s account of the examination before Annas,
the author of &ldquo;Supernatural Religion&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The
Synoptics know nothing of the preliminary examination before Annas, and
the reason given by the writer of the fourth Gospel why the soldiers
first took Jesus to Annas: &lsquo;for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas
who was first high priest that year,&rsquo; is inadmissible. The
assertion is a clear mistake, and it probably originated in a stranger
writing of facts and institutions with which he was not well
acquainted, being misled by an error equally committed by the author of
the third Gospel, and of the Acts of the Apostles.... Such statements,
erroneous in themselves and not understood by the author of the fourth
Gospel, may have led to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>confusion in the narrative. Annas
had previously been high priest, as we know from Josephus, but nothing
is more certain than the fact that the title was not continued after
the office was resigned; and Ishmael, Eleazar, and Simon, who succeeded
Annas and separated his term of office from that of Caiaphas, did not
subsequently bear the title. The narrative is a mistake, and such an
error could not have been committed by a native of Palestine, and much
less by an acquaintance of the high priest&rdquo; (p. 660).</p>

<p>A high priest did not assume the role of prophet, much less would he
have given utterance to the prophecy ascribed to Caiaphas. The Roman
procurator might have expressed such a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

according to Roman law and ethics an individual could be sacrificed for
the welfare of the state. The high priest, on the other hand, could not
have uttered such a sentiment, because it was abhorrent to the Jewish
mind. If all Israel could have been saved, and could have been saved
only by the death of one of its innocent members, that member could not
have been put to death, because, according to Jewish law, it would have
made of every Jew concerned in it a murderer. It was a fundamental
principle of the Jewish code that, &ldquo;No human life must be

<p>All: Blasphemy.</p>
<p>Jesus, it was charged, had declared himself to be the son of God.
This, if true, would not have constituted blasphemy. It was no offense
against the law for a man to claim that he was the son of God. All men,
and especially all good men, were recognized as the sons of God.
Referring to Christ&rsquo;s claim, a Jewish writer says: &ldquo;No law,
no precedent, and no fictitious case in the Bible or the rabbinical
literature, can be cited to make of this expression a case of
blasphemy.&rdquo; And even if he had been proven guilty of blasphemy,
he could not have been put to death, for blasphemy, at this time, had
ceased to be a capital offense. And is it reasonable to suppose that
the Romans would have condemned a man to death for an offense against a
religion in which they did not themselves believe, but which they
regarded as one of the vilest of superstitions? It may be urged that in
his trial before Pilate the charge was changed to sedition. This charge
was not sustained.</p>

<p>When every step thus far taken by the council had been illegal, why
should it have been so particular in regard to the witnesses? The fact
is the Evangelists were ignorant of Jewish laws. They believed that
while the prosecution of Jesus was unjust it was yet conducted
according to the established rules of Jewish courts. Referring to Mark,
Dr. Wise says: &ldquo;In his ignorance of Jewish law, he imagined the
trial which he described was lawful among the Jews. He proves this, in
the first place, by the very statement that witnesses were sought and
produced. A court convoked and acting in rebellion to law and custom
can be considered only a band of rebels. What use have such men of
witnesses? Being lawless from the beginning, no legal restraint makes
the presence of witnesses necessary.... He certainly thought of an
honest, lawful trial, in the legal form; an honest and legal
examination of witnesses, a fair consideration of the testimony, and
after mature reflection the rejection thereof on account of
insufficiency&rdquo; (Martyrdom of Jesus, pp. 69, 70).</p>

Jesus is said to have done:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There came out of Egypt about this

<p class="first">Did he have a defender or counselor in the
Sanhedrim?</p>
<p>Synoptics: He did not.</p>
<p>According to the Synoptics he had no counsel, and the Sanhedrim were
unanimous in their condemnation of him. This was contrary to Jewish
law. The Sanhedrim might be unanimous in their belief that he was
guilty, but it was the duty of at least one of them to defend him. This
was the law: &ldquo;If none of the judges defend the culprit, i. e.,
all pronounce him guilty, having no defender in the court, the verdict
of guilty was invalid and the sentence of death could not be
executed&rdquo; (Maimonides).</p>
<p>Dr. Geikie admits that the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrim, as
related in the Gospels, was in nearly every particular contrary to
Jewish law. He says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The accused was in all cases to be
held innocent, till proved guilty. It was an axiom, that &lsquo;the
Sanhedrim was to save, not to destroy life.&rsquo; No one could be
tried and condemned in his absence, and when a person accused was
brought before the court, it was the duty of the president, at the
outset, to admonish the witnesses to remember the value of human life,
and to take care that they forgot nothing that would tell in the
prisoner&rsquo;s favor. Nor was he left undefended; a Baal-Rib, or
counsel, was appointed, to see that all possible was done for his
acquittal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>Whatever evidence tended to aid him was to be
freely admitted, and no member of the court who had once spoken in
favor of acquittal could afterwards vote for condemnation. The votes of
the youngest of the judges were taken first, that they might not be
influenced by their seniors. In capital charges, it required a majority
of at least two to condemn, and while the verdict of acquittal could be
given at once, that of guilty could only be pronounced the next day.
Hence, capital trials could not begin on the day preceding a Sabbath,
or public feast. No criminal trial could be carried through in the
night; the judges who condemned any one to death had to fast all the
day before, and no one could be executed on the same day on which the
sentence was pronounced.&rdquo; (Life of Christ, vol. ii, p. 487.)</p>

<p>Concerning this, Mrs. Evans says: &ldquo;With regard to his death,
it was said that the Jews slew him and hanged him on a tree; and again
that he was taken down from the tree; expressions which do not imply
crucifixion, but rather the legal execution for such crimes as the one
alleged, that is, stoning to death and the exposure of the dead body
upon a stake, or a tree&rdquo; (Christ Myth, p. 79).</p>

<p>Every Jew, and every other person acquainted with the Jewish history
of that age, knows that this is false. The Sanhedrim was composed of
the wisest and the best men of that race. Superstitious, bigoted and

<p>These accounts of the trial of Christ before the Sanhedrim afford
overwhelming proof that they were not written by apostles nor by
residents of Palestine. They were written by Gentile Christians, or by
Jewish converts living in foreign lands, and presumably the former, for
even foreign Jews must have possessed a better knowledge of Jewish laws
and customs than the Evangelists display.</p>

at Jerusalem (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

6&ndash;11</a>).</p>
<p>In the matter of trials the Evangelists, as in everything else, have
overdone things. Notwithstanding no trial was ever held during the
Passover they give him four trials in one day, and not finding courts
enough in Judea for the purpose, they import one from Galilee.</p>
<p>There is nothing more improbable than this alleged examination of
Jesus by Herod. Imagine the Governor General of Canada sitting in
judgment on a criminal at Washington, because the criminal is a
Canadian, or an Ohio court holding a session in New York because the
prisoner arraigned once lived in Ohio. The offenses with which Jesus
was charged were committed, not in Herod&rsquo;s province, Galilee, but
in Pilate&rsquo;s province, Judea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237"
href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is strange that John, who pretends to relate every important
event connected with the trial of Jesus, should omit his trial before
Herod. Concerning this Strauss says: &ldquo;The conjecture, that it may
probably have appeared to him [John] too unimportant, loses all
foundation when it is considered that John does not scorn to mention
the leading away to Annas, which nevertheless was equally indecisive;
and in general, the narrative of these events in John is, as
Schleiermacher himself confesses, so consecutive that it nowhere
presents a break in which such an episode could be inserted. Hence even
Schleiermacher at last takes refuge in the conjecture that possibly the
sending to Herod may have escaped the notice of John, because it
happened on an opposite side to that on which the disciple stood,
through a back door; and that it came to the knowledge of Luke because
his informant had an acquaintance in the household of Herod, as John
had in that of Annas; the former conjecture, however, is figuratively
as well as literally nothing more than a back door; the latter, a
fiction which is but the effort of despair&rdquo; (<span lang=

<p>It is impossible to believe that the highest court of a country
would pronounce a prisoner innocent and then condemn him to death.
Judicial murders are sometimes committed, but the murderers do not
confess their guilt.</p>
<p>It is declared that Pilate desired to release Jesus but could not.
Who ruled Judea, Pilate or the Sanhedrim? According to the Evangelists,
the Romans ruled Judea, while the Jews ruled the Romans.</p>
<p>Between the Pilate of the New Testament and the Pilate of history
there is nothing in common. The Pilate of the New Testament is
subservient to the Jews, acceding to their every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=

The Pilate of history is noted for his hatred of the Jews and his
cruelties to them. It was these which provoked his recall.</p>

<p>These indignities Jesus is said to have suffered, not at the hands
of a Jewish mob, but at the hands of a Roman court, from which the Jews
had absented themselves and whose proceedings they could not witness
nor directly influence. Every lawyer knows that for more than two
thousand years the Roman court has been the world&rsquo;s model for
dignity and fairness. That an innocent and defenseless prisoner was
subjected to these insults and brutalities in a Roman court, presided
over by a Roman governor, none but a slave of superstition can
believe.</p>

<p>There is no historical authority whatever for this alleged custom.
It was a custom that the Roman government in Judea could not with
safety adopt. The Jews were a subject people, waiting and hoping for an
opportunity to throw off the Roman yoke. To release to them
&ldquo;whomsoever they desired&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"

endanger the government itself. This story was probably suggested by a
custom of the Roman emperors who released a prisoner at their birthday

<p>The original of this account of the mocking of Jesus is to be found
in Philo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Adversus Flaccum,&rdquo; written more than one
hundred years before the Gospels made their appearance. Herod Agrippa
was on his way from Rome to Palestine to assume the government of that
country. When he stopped at Alexandria his enemies, to annoy him,
instituted a mock coronation, which Philo relates as follows:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There was a certain poor wretch
named Carrabas, who spent all his days and nights in the roads, the
sport of idle children and wanton youths; and the multitude, having
driven him as far as the public gymnasium, and having set him up there
on high, that he might be seen of everybody, flattening out a papyrus
leaf, put it on his head instead of a crown, and clothed the rest of
his body with a common mat in place of a robe, and in lieu of a sceptre
thrust into his hand a reed, which they found lying by the wayside. And
when he had received all the insignia of royalty, and had been dressed
and adorned like a king, young men bearing sticks on their shoulders
stood on each side of him in imitation of guards, while others came up,
some as if to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=

causes before him&rdquo; (Philo&rsquo;s Works, vol. iv, pp. 68,

<p>Calvary, like Golgotha, means a place of skulls in the vicinity of
Jerusalem. The explanation given by Christian commentators is that
&ldquo;it was a spot where executions ordinarily took place, and
therefore abounded in skulls.&rdquo; Fleetwood says it &ldquo;was
called Golgotha, or Place of Skulls, from the criminals&rsquo; bones
which lay scattered there&rdquo; (Life of Christ, p. 416). Where Jewish
customs prevailed&mdash;and it is admitted that they did prevail in
Jerusalem and Judea at this time, and had for hundreds of years&mdash;a
human skull or bone was not allowed to be exposed for even a moment.

<p>The Evangelists do not say that he was nailed to the cross; but it
has been inferred from the texts mentioned in Luke and John that he
was. In crucifixion the victim was usually bound to the cross. Nails
were sometimes driven through the hands, but never through the feet.
The allusions to the supposed wounds on his hands and feet were
evidently inserted in the accounts for the purpose of establishing his
identity after the resurrection. Great prominence has been given them
by Christians in order to make Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion appear
especially cruel and create sympathy for him.</p>

the crucifixion may have occurred as late as three o&rsquo;clock in the

<p>It has been attempted to explain the discrepancy between Mark and
John by supposing that John used a different method of reckoning time.
Concerning this, Prof. Sanday, one of England&rsquo;s highest orthodox
authorities, says: &ldquo;The writer of this was at one time inclined
to look with favor on these attempts. If the premise could be proved,
the data would work out satisfactorily.... But it must definitely be
said that the major premise cannot be proved, and that the attempt to
reconcile the two statements on this basis breaks down.&rdquo;</p>

garments and vesture are the same thing&mdash;the clothing of the

<p>With the Four Gospels before them, Christians do not know what his

of Dr. Farrar and Dr. Geikie. These writers were contemporaries and
friends, and both <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254"

with these Gospels for their authorities, attempt to portray the
closing scene. I quote from each:</p>
<p>Dr. Farrar: &ldquo;And now the end was come. Once more, in the words
of the sweet Psalmist of Israel, but adding to them that title of
trustful love which, through Him, is permitted to the use of all
mankind, &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;into Thy hands I commend
my spirit.&rsquo; Then with one more great effort he uttered the last
cry&mdash;the one victorious word, &lsquo;<span class="sc">It is
finished.</span>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Geikie: &ldquo;A moment more, and all was over. The cloud had
passed as suddenly as it rose. Far and wide, over the vanquished
throngs of his enemies, with a loud voice, as if uttering his shout of
eternal victory before entering into his glory, he cried, &lsquo;It is
finished!&rsquo; Then, more gently, came the words, &lsquo;<span class=

<p>Is it probable that a man in the agonies of a terrible death would
devote his expiring breath to a recital of Hebrew poetry? When even the
dying words of this Christ are borrowed, is it not evident that the
whole story of his life is fabulous?</p>
<p>The accounts of the crucifixion given by the Evangelists are to a
large extent reproductions of the 22d Psalm, even to the language
itself, the poetical allusions of the psalmist being transformed into
alleged historical facts. The devout Christian who is familiar with
this Passion Psalm sees in the Evangelists&rsquo; account of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=

<p>This is additional proof of Matthew&rsquo;s ignorance of Hebrew. He
supposes a similarity of sound between the two words, whereas they were
utterly unlike in pronunciation. Eli was pronounced Ali (long a), while
Elias was pronounced Eleeyahu. But even had they been so much alike in
sound that one might have been mistaken for the other, as Matthew
supposes, the alleged incident is disproved by the fact that the Jews
were not allowed to attend the execution, while to the Romans the words

<p>In regard to these alleged last words of Jesus, Dr. Hooykaas says:
&ldquo;It seems to us far more probable that these words of the
Messianic passion-psalm were put into the mouth of Jesus by tradition
than that he really uttered them. The sequel, too, throws great
suspicion on the report; for the Jews were not allowed to approach the
cross, and what did the Roman soldiers know about Elijah? Besides, if
the Jews had really heard him cry &ldquo;Eli!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Eloi!&rdquo; they would hardly have mistaken the words of the
twenty-second Psalm for a cry to the precursor of the Messianic
kingdom&mdash;a mistake upon which their raillery is made to depend. We
must, therefore, put aside these words, as in all probability
unhistorical&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, vol. iii, p. 454).</p>

<p>Instead of going to the Christian Heaven above, they went to the
Jewish-Pagan Sheol (Hell) below. Did Jesus recant on the cross? Did he
renounce the Kingdom of God when God deserted him? Concerning this
remarkable passage, Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo;
says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Rabbis in the time of our
Savior taught there was a region of the world of the dead, of Sheol, in
the heart of the earth. Gehenna was on one side, with its flames and
torments; Paradise on the other, the intermediate home of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>blessed.... It is significant, indeed, that the
word &lsquo;paradise&rsquo; nowhere occurs in the public teaching of
our Lord, or in his intercourse with his disciples. Connected as it had
been with the thoughts of a sensuous happiness, it was not the fittest
nor the best word for those whom he was training to rise out of
sensuous thoughts to the higher regions of the spiritual life. For
them, accordingly, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Kingdom of God, are the
words most dwelt on. With the thief dying on the cross the case was
different. We can assume nothing in the robber-outlaw but the most
rudimentary forms of the popular belief. The answer to his prayer gave
him what he needed most, the assurance of immediate rest and
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explanation of the apologist is as lame as the story of the
Evangelist. Did Jesus go to Hell with the thief because the thief was
unfit to go to Heaven with him? This apologist says that Jesus used
these words&mdash;gave expression to a false doctrine&mdash;because the
thief was incapable of comprehending the true doctrine. But this
conflicts with the alleged words of the thief himself which show that
he did comprehend the nature of the kingdom of Heaven. It was this, and
not the peace of the grave, for which he prayed.</p>

<p class="first">What is said to have issued from the wound?</p>
<p>John: &ldquo;And forthwith came there out blood and water&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2019:34">xix,
34</a>).</p>
<p>According to a well known physiological fact, if Jesus was still
alive or had but recently expired, not blood and water, but blood alone
would have flowed from the wound. If he was dead, and it is stated that
he was, then neither blood nor water would have flowed from it. When
blood is drawn from a living body it becomes separated into two parts,
a thick substance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261"
name="pb261">261</a>]</span>known as febrine, and a watery fluid known
as serum. John was familiar with this fact and supposed that this also
took place in a corpse, which is not the case.</p>
<p>Dr. Cabanes, a noted physician of Paris, writes as follows regarding
the crucifixion of Jesus:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It appears that crucifixion alone
could not have produced the death of Jesus, and in reference to the
wounds produced by the nails, these wounds being the result of
crushing, the hemorrhage was small. A burning fever might possibly
occur which would be manifested by an intense thirst, but the flow of
blood could not be sufficient to cause death. Death in this case is
preceded by a comatose condition which would be inconsistent with the
cry uttered in a loud voice by Jesus shortly before his last breath.
All the commentators of the gospels further agree that Jesus did not
remain more than three to six hours on the cross, and death cannot be
produced by an exposure of this duration to this mode of torture.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The generally accepted version of
the lance wound received by Jesus is that the blow was struck on the
left side and that there flowed from the wound water mingled with
blood. It has been correctly remarked that blood does not flow from a
corpse, and therefore if blood followed the lance stroke, Jesus must
have been alive; further, in order that the blow might have killed the
dying man, it must have injured a vital organ. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>It
must be observed that a lance directed upward and from right to left
could not reach the right-hand cavities of the heart without first
opening the peritoneal cavity, traversing the liver, the pericardium
and perhaps the pleura. We must therefore ask how the few hundred grams
of blood which a right ventricle could contain, could penetrate to the
exterior of the body after such a great wound. Also with those who die
slowly there is found a distended heart in which the blood has very
rapidly coagulated, and it must follow that if a flood of the liquid
appeared on the side of Jesus it could not have come from the heart.
With regard to the vena cava, its situation is too far back to have
allowed it to be touched by the lance. If the wound had been in the
stomach a lesion of the digestive tube would have been disclosed by an
ejection of blood mingled with alimentary matter, either from the mouth
or the opening of the wound, or at least by a discharge of blood into
the abdominal cavity. Had the liver been touched the symptoms of an
internal hemorrhage would have been observed, as in the case of
President Carnot, in whose case the blow of the poignard, directed
downward, perforated the liver and the portal vein, inducing a state of
coma, whereas Jesus, we have been told, cried out with a loud voice. We
thus see that death was not due to the lance wound or to the torture of
crucifixion, as so often stated.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

not occur.</p>
<p>If we accept the claims of their followers, nearly all the gods and
heroes of antiquity expired amid the convulsions of Nature. The soul of
Romulus went out amid the battling of her elements; &ldquo;the sun was
darkened and the sky rained fire and ashes&rdquo; when the Hindu
Krishna left his saddened followers; &ldquo;the earth shook, the rocks
were rent, the graves opened, and in a storm which threatened the
dissolution of the universe,&rdquo; Prometheus closed his earthly
career; a pall of darkness settled over Egypt when her Osiris died; the
death of Alexander was succeeded by six hours of preternatural gloom;

<p>According to Matthew and Luke this darkness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=

the cross until he died. Yet his executioners are ignorant of it. Luke
says: &ldquo;His acquaintances, and the women that followed him from
Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things [the
crucifixion]&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2023:49">xxiii,
49</a>), which they could not have done had this darkness really
occurred.</p>
<p>If this darkness occurred, and began at the sixth hour, as stated by
the Synoptics, then, according to John, the conclusion of the trial,
the sentencing of Jesus, the preparations for his execution, and the
journey to Golgotha, all took place during the darkness, a conclusion
which the nature of the narrative utterly precludes.</p>
<p>Christian apologists have cited Phlegon who notices an eclipse which
occurred about this time. But there is a variance of at least six years
in regard to the time that Jesus was crucified. Besides an eclipse
could not have occurred within two weeks of a Passover, on the
occurrence of which he is declared to have been executed. Farrar says:
&ldquo;It could have been no darkness of any natural eclipse, for the
Paschal moon was at the full&rdquo; (Life of Christ, p. 505). Geikie
says: &ldquo;It is impossible to explain the origin of this darkness.
The Passover moon was then at the full, so that it could not have been
an eclipse. The earlier fathers, relying on a notice of an eclipse that
seemed to coincide in time, though it really did not, fancied that the
darkness was caused by it, but incorrectly&rdquo; (Life of Christ,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=

<p class="first">Was the veil of the temple rent, as our Gospel of
Matthew declares?</p>
<p>The Gospel of Matthew, it is affirmed, originally appeared in
Hebrew, St. Jerome, who had this original version, says: &ldquo;In that
Gospel which is written in Hebrew letters, we read, not that the veil
of the temple was rent, but that a lintel (or beam) of a prodigious
size fell down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commenting on this alleged prodigy, the rending of the veil, Strauss
says: &ldquo;Now the object of the divine Providence in effecting such
a miracle could only have been this: to produce in the Jewish
contemporaries of Jesus a deep impression of the importance of his
death, and to furnish the first promulgators of the gospel with a fact
to which they might appeal in support of their cause. But, as
Schleiermacher has shown, nowhere else in the New Testament, either in
the apostolic epistles or in Acts, or even in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, in connection with the subject of which it could scarcely fail
to be suggested, is this event mentioned: on the contrary, with the
exception of this bare Synoptical notice, every trace of it is lost;
which could scarcely have been the case if it had really formed a
ground of apostolical argument. Thus the divine purpose in ordaining
this miracle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=

inconceivable, it cannot have been ordained for this object&mdash;in

Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the East, and the Mount
of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof ... and half of the
mountain shall remove toward the North, and half of it toward the
South.... Ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in
the days of Uzziah King of Judah; and the Lord my God shall come, and
all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=

<p>Concerning this Dr. Wise says: &ldquo;God who comes, according to
Zachariah, to fight for Jerusalem, will stand upon Mount Olivet.
Therefore, Jesus, during his fight against Pharisees, Sadducees and
priests, had to make his principal home on Mount Olivet. But he could
not split the mountain, as Zachariah imagined God would, and move one
part North and the other South; therefore, the curtain of the temple
had to be torn in twain when Jesus died, although none has ever
mentioned the fact. The curtain was there some thirty-five years after
the death of Jesus; had it been torn, <span class="corr" id="xd21e8432"
title="Source: sombody">somebody</span> must have noticed it. The
earthquake mentioned by Zachariah, of course, was borrowed to embellish
Calvary.... Because Zachariah states God coming to Jerusalem,
&lsquo;And the Lord my God cometh, all the saints with thee,&rsquo;
therefore the saints and not the sinners had to resurrect and visit the
city on that particular day. But in the fertile imagination of
Zachariah, the day of that terrible combat must be dark.... This
darkness was transported over to Calvary to embellish the scene.... So
these miracles were not wrought, but the entire outer embellishment of
Calvary is taken from Zachariah; not because it was believed this
prophecy referred to Jesus, but simply because the evangelical writers
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=

<p>This punishment, known as crurifragium, was a distinct mode of

believe that they did not execute it in the case of Jesus. It is not
reasonable to suppose, however, that Roman soldiers either were in the
habit of disregarding their orders, or could have any motive for doing
so in this case, and subjecting themselves to the severe punishment for
disobedience inflicted by Roman military law. It is argued that they
saw that Jesus was already dead, and, therefore, that it was not
necessary to break his legs; but soldiers are not in the habit of
thinking in this way; they are disciplined to obey&rdquo; (p. 993).</p>

<p>Mary must have been a very popular name to be given to two daughters
of the same family. It is not probable that these sisters were both
named Mary. John never mentions the name of Jesus&rsquo; mother, and it
is evident that he did not suppose her name was Mary. Were John the
only Gospel, Christians would be ignorant of the Virgin&rsquo;s name.

<p>In sepulture of this kind, the tomb was not closed until the third
day, and when once closed it was not to be opened. This deviation from
the customary mode is evidently for the purpose of establishing faith
in the doctrine of the resurrection, by shutting off all means of
escape or removal without supernatural aid. The Evangelists are

Jesus &lsquo;on the feast day,&rsquo; and then actually arrest him on
that day; that not only the guards, but one of the disciples carries
arms, which on the feast day was not allowed; that the trial was also

<p class="first">In what year was Jesus crucified?</p>
<p>Not one of the Evangelists knows. They agree <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>that
he was crucified during the time that Pontius Pilate was procurator of
Judea, and Joseph Caiaphas was high priest of the Jews. But this, so
far as Matthew, Mark and John are concerned, may have been any time
from 26 to 36 A. D.</p>
<p>Luke, while he does not state the particular year, nor furnish data
for determining it, is more definite. He says that Jesus began his
ministry in &ldquo;the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius
Caesar,&rdquo; and his narrative clearly implies that he was crucified
at the following Passover. Tiberius commenced his reign in August, 14
A. D. The fifteenth year of his reign, then, extended from August, 28
A. D., to August, 29 A. D. If Jesus began his ministry during the first
months of this year, he might have been crucified as early as the
spring of 29. But it is generally conceded that the time which this
would allow for his ministry was far too brief, and that he could not
have been crucified before 30 A. D.</p>
<p>The Christian Fathers who, for the most part, accepted the tradition
of Luke and affirmed that his ministry lasted but one year, or less,
held that the crucifixion occurred in 29 A. D.</p>
<p>Scribner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo; gives preference to
29 A. D. Cuthbert Hamilton Turner, M.A., Oxford, the New Testament
chronologist of that work, after a lengthy review of the subject, says:
&ldquo;To sum up briefly, the separate results of five lines of enquiry
harmonize with one another beyond expectation, so that each in turn
supplies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>fresh security for the rest. The nativity in B.
C. 7&ndash;6; the age of our Lord at the baptism, 30 years, more or
less; the baptism in A. D. 26 (26&ndash;27); the duration of the
ministry between two and three years; the crucifixion in A. D.
29.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This authority states that his ministry lasted two or three years.
It was necessary to do this or reject John. By taking a year or more
from John&rsquo;s ministry of Jesus and adding it to the one year
ministry of the Synoptics&mdash;by assuming that the Synoptics omit to
mention one or more Passovers, and that one of the Passovers mentioned
by John was some other feast&mdash;it pretends to have reconciled the
discrepancy regarding the length of Christ&rsquo;s ministry. But if his
ministry lasted two or three years, as affirmed, he could not have been
crucified in 29 A. D.</p>
<p>With orthodox commentators, a favorite method of reconciling Old
Testament dates, as I have noted in a previous work, is to assume that
a king, concerning the date of whose accession, or length of reign, a
discrepancy appears, reigned in consort with his predecessor for a
number of years sufficient to cover the discrepancy. This dishonest
method of explanation&mdash;for it is a dishonest trick, intended to
deceive the reader and hide from him an error&mdash;has been employed
to reconcile Luke and John. By assuming that Tiberius divided the
government with Augustus for two years preceding his accession to the
throne, an assumption for which there is no credible authority,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>and that Luke accordingly reckons the fifteenth
year from 12 A. D., instead of 14 A. D., when he really became emperor,
it is possible to give Jesus a ministry of two or three years and still
have him crucified in 29 A. D. But another irreconcilable difficulty
remains. The Synoptics state that he was crucified on the Passover and
on the day preceding the Sabbath, that is, on Friday. If so, he could
not have been crucified in 29 A. D., for the Passover did not fall on
Friday that year.</p>
<p>Dr. Farrar says it is &ldquo;highly probable that the crucifixion
took place at the passover of March, 30 A. D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice Bradley of the United States Supreme Court, who made an
exhaustive examination of all the evidence and arguments bearing on the
question, decided in favor of 30 A. D. He says: &ldquo;There were only
three years from A. D. 27 to A. D. 36, inclusive, in which the 1st of
Nisan, and consequently the 15th of Nisan, happened on Friday, and
these were A. D. 27, 30 and 33, the last of which is very doubtful. But
the crucifixion could not have happened before A. D. 28, and probably
not later than A. D. 31. Therefore the year 30 is the only one which
satisfies all the conditions of the problem.... Now, since in A. D. 30,
the 1st of Nisan fell on Friday, the 24th of March, the 15th fell on
Friday, the 7th of April, which was the day of the
crucifixion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Farrar and Justice Bradley are agreed in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>regard to the year of the crucifixion, but they
are not agreed in regard to the calendar month in which it occurred.
Dr. Farrar says it occurred in March; Justice Bradley says it occurred
in April.</p>
<p>Justice Bradley says that 30 A. D. satisfies all the conditions. It
does satisfy the conditions of the Synoptics, but it does not satisfy
the conditions of John, as claimed. To satisfy the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e8783" title="Source: condi-ditions">conditions</span> of John
it is necessary to adopt the untenable hypothesis of 12 A. D. as the
date of Tiberius Caesar&rsquo;s accession. But whatever satisfies the
conditions of John must necessarily conflict with those of the
Synoptics.</p>
<p>Some Christian scholars place the crucifixion in 31 A. D., others in
32 A. D. But neither year can be harmonized with the Synoptics&rsquo;
statement that he was put to death on the Passover, or with
John&rsquo;s that he suffered on the day of Preparation. Neither can
they be harmonized with either the Synoptics or John in regard to the
duration of his ministry.</p>
<p>It is probable that a majority of Christian scholars today believe
that Jesus was crucified in 33. Renan accepted this date. He says:
&ldquo;According to the calculation we adopt, the death of Jesus
happened in the year 33 of our era. It could not, at all events, be
either before the year 29, the preaching of John and Jesus having
commenced in the year 28, or after 35, since in the year 36,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>and probably before the Passover, Pilate and
Kaiapha both lost their offices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The adoption of 33 allows for the four years&rsquo; ministry
ascribed to Jesus by John, but it cannot be reconciled with the brief
ministry ascribed to him by the Synoptics. As for Renan, who in the
first edition of his &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; accepted the authenticity of
John, but subsequently rejected it and accepted only the Synoptics, he
has no Evangelistic authority for 33.</p>
<p>The Dutch theologians, Kuenen, Oort and Hooykaas, and many other
Rationalists, give 35 A. D. the preference. To accept this year,
however, it is necessary to reject the Passover crucifixion, and to
assign to Jesus a much longer ministry than even John assigns.</p>
<p>Of one hundred Christian authorities who attempt to name the year in
which Christ was crucified, twenty-three say 29, eighteen 30, nine 31,
seven 32, thirty-seven 33, and six 35 A. D.</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that not a year that can be named can be
harmonized with the accounts of the crucifixion given in the four
gospels. The result is that there is as great a lack of agreement in
regard to the time of Christ&rsquo;s death as there is in regard to the
time of his birth. Christians do not know when he was born, they do not
know when he died, they cannot prove that he lived.</p>

Nisan 15) the crucifixion. St. John, on the other hand, by a number of

<p>This discrepancy is not, like many other Bible discrepancies, an
unintentional error. It represents a conflict between two dogmas. The
primitive church was rent with dissensions regarding this question,
some contending that Christ suffered on the 14th Nisan, others that it
was on the 15th. During the second century&mdash;the century in which
our gospels appeared&mdash;this controversy was especially bitter.</p>
<p>According to John (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%201:29">i, 29</a>,
<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2019:33-36">xix,
33, 36</a>) Jesus was the Paschal Lamb, and as such, must be slain on
the day of Preparation. The slaying of the lambs began at three
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the hour at which Jesus is said to have
expired. The Synoptics, on the other hand, in order to enable him to
partake of the Paschal meal and institute the Eucharist, which is a
survival and perpetuation of the Passover, must prolong his existence
until after this meal, and consequently his crucifixion cannot take
place until the following day. It was impossible for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>him
to be the Paschal Lamb and at the same time partake of the Paschal
meal. This necessarily produced a schism. The Fourth Gospel was written
in support of the one side, the Synoptics in support of the other.</p>
<p>It is declared by the most eminent fathers of the second century
that the Apostle John, whom some of them had known, was accustomed to
observe the Paschal meal. This is another argument against the
Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel.</p>
<p>Referring to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, as recorded in John, the
&ldquo;Bible for Learners&rdquo; says: &ldquo;It was not the Paschal
meal. The Passover did not begin until the following evening; for he
himself who was the true Paschal Lamb, and as such made an end of all
sacrifices, must be put to death at the very day and hour ordained for
the slaughter of the lamb&mdash;not twenty-four hours later as the
Synoptic Gospels say&rdquo; (Vol. iii, p. 684).</p>
<p>Admitting the discrepancy, but without determining which is correct,
Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The crowning
application of the Paschal rites to the truths of which they were the
shadowy promises appears to be that which is afforded by the fact that
our Lord&rsquo;s death occurred during the festival. According to the
Divine purpose, the true Lamb of God was slain at nearly the same time
as &lsquo;the Lord&rsquo;s Passover,&rsquo; in obedience to the letter
of the law.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287"
name="pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was not &ldquo;according to the Divine purpose&rdquo; that Jesus
was slain at the Passover, but it was according to a human invention
that he is declared to have been slain at this time. These attempts to
connect the crucifixion with the Passover afford the strongest proof
that it is a myth.</p>

<p>These utterances are alleged to have been made early in his
ministry. Now, the cross as a Christian symbol is supposed to have been
adopted after, and not until after, the crucifixion. Its introduction
in the passages quoted suggests one of two things: either that the
Synoptics put into the mouth of Jesus words that he never uttered, or
that the cross, as a religious symbol, was used before the crucifixion,
in which case its adoption by the church is no proof of the
crucifixion.</p>

<p>Webster defines this word as follows: &ldquo;1. To nail to a cross;
to put to death by nailing the hands and feet to a cross or gibbet,
sometimes, anciently, by fastening a criminal to a tree with cords. 2.
In scriptural language, to subdue; to mortify; to destroy the power or
ruling influence of. 3. To reject and despise. 4. To vex or
torment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first, only, denotes a physical crucifixion, which, it is
claimed, Christ suffered. The word, as used by Paul, in most instances,
clearly denotes a crucifying of the passions and carnal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>pleasures, and the exceptions, when taken in
connection with Paul&rsquo;s well known teachings, and allowing for the
probable corruption of the original text, do not confirm the
Evangelistic accounts of the crucifixion. Besides this it is admitted
that Paul did not witness the crucifixion, and that these Epistles,
even if authentic, were not written until nearly thirty years after it
is said to have occurred.</p>
<p>In the eighteen books which follow, the word crucify appears but
twice&mdash;in Hebrews (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%206:6">vi, 6</a>) and
in Revelation (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2011:8">xi, 8</a>).
The word crucifixion does not appear once in the Bible.</p>
<p>Concerning the books we have been considering in this criticism,
Paine writes as follows: &ldquo;Whether the fourteen epistles ascribed
to Paul were written by him or not, is a matter of indifference; they
are either argumentative or dogmatical; and as the argument is
defective and the dogmatical part is merely presumptive, it signifies
not who wrote them. And the same may be said for the remaining parts of
the Testament. It is not upon the Epistles, but upon what is called the
Gospel, contained in the four books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and John, and upon the pretended prophecies, that the theory of the
church calling itself the Christian Church is founded. The Epistles are
dependent upon those, and must follow their fate; for if the story of
Jesus Christ be fabulous, all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"

<p class="first">How old was Jesus at the time of his death?</p>
<p>Luke: He was but little more than thirty years old.</p>
<p>John: He was nearly fifty. In a controversy with the Jews, during
his ministry, he said: &ldquo;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my
day: and he saw, and was glad. Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art
not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%208:56-57">viii, 56,
57</a>.) This implies that he was nearly fifty at this time.</p>
<p>Discussing the question of Jesus&rsquo; age, St. Irenaeus, the most
renowned of the early Christian Fathers, and the founder of the New
Testament canon, who lived in the century immediately following Jesus,
says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He [Christ] came to save all
through means of himself&mdash;all I say, who through him are born
again to God&mdash;infants and children, and boys, and youths, and old
men. He therefore passed through every age; becoming an infant for
infants, thus sanctifying infants; a child for children, thus
sanctifying those who are of this age, being at the same time made to
them an example of piety, righteousness and submission; a youth for
youths, becoming an example to youths, and thus sanctifying them for
the Lord. So likewise, he was an old man for old men, that he might be
a perfect master for all; not merely <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>as respects the
setting forth of the truth, but also as regards age; sanctifying at the
same time, the aged also, and becoming an example to them likewise.
Then, at last, he came on to death itself, that he might be the first
born from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence;
the Prince of Life, existing before all, and going before all&rdquo;
(Against Heresies, Book iv, ch. xxii, sec. 4).</p>
<p>Commenting on the passage quoted from John, Irenaeus says:
&ldquo;But besides this, those very Jews who thus disputed with the
Lord Jesus Christ, have most closely indicated the same thing. For when
the Lord said to them, &lsquo;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my
day, and he saw it, and was glad;&rsquo; they answered him, &lsquo;Thou
art not yet fifty years old; and hast thou seen Abraham?&rsquo; Now,
such language is fittingly applied to one who has already passed the
age of forty, without having yet reached his fiftieth year, yet is not
far from this latter period. But to one who is only thirty years old,
it would unquestionably be said, &lsquo;Thou art not yet forty years
old.&rsquo; For those who wished to convict him of falsehood, would
certainly not extend the number of his years far beyond the age which
they saw he had attained.... It is altogether unreasonable to suppose
that they were mistaken by twenty years, when they wished to prove him
younger than the times of Abraham.... <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>He did not then want
much of being fifty years old&rdquo; (Ibid. sec. 6).</p>
<p>Nor did Irenaeus depend upon the Fourth Gospel alone for his
authority. He was the companion of the aged Polycarp, whom Christians
claim to have been the companion of the Apostle John. Concerning the
testimony of Polycarp and others, he writes: &ldquo;Those who were
conversant in Asia with John, the disciple of the Lord, [testify] that
John conveyed to them that information. And he (John) remained among
them up to the times of Tragan. Some of them, moreover, saw not only
John, but the other apostles also, and heard the same account from
them, and bear testimony to the statement&rdquo; (Ib., sec. 5).</p>
<p>In regard to this testimony of the &ldquo;divine Irenaeus,&rdquo; as
he is called, Godfrey Higgins says: &ldquo;The church has been guilty
of the oversight of letting this passage from Irenaeus escape. One of
the earliest, most respected, and most quoted of its ancient bishops,
saints and martyrs, tells us in distinct words that Jesus was not
crucified under Herod and Pontius Pilate, but that he lived to be
turned fifty years of age. This he tells us on the authority of his
master, St. Polycarp, also a martyr, who had it from St. John himself,
and from all the old people of Asia&rdquo; (Anacalypsis).</p>
<p>Of this testimony and its consequences, Judge Waite, in his
&ldquo;History of Christianity&rdquo; (pp. 329, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>330)
says: &ldquo;It must be remembered that Irenaeus had been a companion
of Polycarp and others who had seen John, and that he was speaking of
what had come to his personal knowledge from the elders in Asia. If,
then, Irenaeus tells the truth, the evidence in favor of the fact is
almost overwhelming. If, on the other hand, he would deliberately
falsify in a matter of this importance, what is his testimony worth as
to the origin of the four gospels? Against this evidence, we have only
the silence of the gospels. But if the silence of the Synoptics is
consistent with a ministry of three or four years, why is not the
further silence of all the gospels consistent with a ministry of twenty
years?</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How would such a theory affect the
received chronology concerning Christ? The date of the crucifixion at
not later than A. D. 36, or when Christ was, by the received
chronology, forty years old, is settled by the fact, that in that year,
Pontius Pilate was removed from his government.... If, then, it be
accepted as a historical fact that Christ was about fifty years old at
this crucifixion, the date of his birth would have to be set back at
least ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every line of these accounts of the trial and crucifixion of Christ
bears the ineffaceable stamp of fiction. There was no Christ to
crucify, and Jesus of Nazareth, if he existed, was not crucified as
claimed.</p>
<p>For more than fifteen centuries an inoffensive, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>industrious and moral people have been
persecuted, robbed and butchered by Christians, because their
forefathers are said to have slain a mythical God.</p>
<p>Supposing that from the myth of Prometheus had sprung a popular
religion, which, in its day, had, like the religions of Osiris,
Bacchus, Krishna and Christ, overspread the earth. Then think of the
devotees of this religion massacring the Hellenists because Zeus had
crucified Prometheus! How long must our mythology, with all its
attendant evils, rule and curse the world? How long must an innocent
people suffer for an alleged crime that was never committed?

<p>If they came &ldquo;in the end of the Sabbath,&rdquo; and Jesus had
already risen, then his resurrection took place, not on the first day
of the week, as claimed, but on the seventh day. Matthew was a Jew; yet
the author of this Gospel was seemingly ignorant of the Jewish method
of computing time, according to which the Sabbath began and ended at
sunset. He evidently supposed that the night preceding their visit to
the tomb belonged to the seventh day, whereas it belonged to the first
day.</p>

<p>The last chapter of this Gospel which contains the account of his
fourth appearance, and which ascribes the authorship of the Gospel to
the &ldquo;beloved disciple&rdquo; (John), is a forgery.</p>
<p>No two of the Evangelists agree. No two of them are fully agreed in
regard to a single appearance. Each not only omits the appearances
mentioned by the others, but his narrative in nearly every instance
excludes them. As Strauss says, &ldquo;The designation of the locality
in one excludes the appearances narrated by the rest; the determination
of time in another leaves no space for the narratives of his
fellow-evangelists; the enumeration of a third is given without any
regard to the events reported by his predecessors; lastly, among
several appearances recounted by various narrators, each claims to be
the last, and yet has nothing in common with the others. Hence nothing
but wilful blindness can prevent the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>perception that no
one of the narrators knew and presupposed what another
records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Referring to the different accounts of the resurrection given by the
Evangelists, Dr. Westcott says: &ldquo;They contain difficulties which
it is impossible to explain with certainty&rdquo; (Introduction to
Study of Gospels, p. 329).</p>
<p>Dr. Farrar makes the following admission: &ldquo;Any one who will
attentively read side by side the narratives of these appearances on
the first day of the resurrection, will see that they have only been
preserved for us in general, interblended, and scattered notices,
which, in strict exactness, render it impossible, without many
arbitrary suppositions, to produce from them a certain narrative of the
order of events. The lacunae, the compressions, the variations, the
actual differences, the subjectivity of the narrators as affected by
spiritual revelations, render all harmonies at the best
uncertain&rdquo; (Life of Christ, vol. ii, p. 432, note).</p>

<p class="first">State the appearances mentioned by Paul.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. &ldquo;He was seen of Cephas.&rdquo;</li>
<li>2. &ldquo;Then of the twelve.&rdquo;</li>
<li>3. &ldquo;After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at
once.&rdquo;</li>
<li>4. &ldquo;After that he was seen of James.&rdquo;</li>
<li>5. &ldquo;Then of all the apostles.&rdquo;</li>
<li>6. &ldquo;And last of all he was seen of me also.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul says that his first appearance was to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>Peter. This contradicts all of the Evangelists.
His next appearance, Paul declares, was to the twelve. But there were
no twelve at this time; for Judas had deserted them and his successor
had not been elected. Paul evidently knew nothing of the betrayal of
Jesus by Judas. He says Jesus was seen by five hundred brethren at
once. The Evangelists are all ignorant of this appearance, while the
author of Acts states that there were but one hundred and twenty
&ldquo;brethren&rdquo; in all, and even this number is considered too
large by critics. He says that he appeared to James, an appearance of
which the Evangelists know nothing. After this he states that he was
seen of all the apostles. This is the only appearance mentioned by Paul
which can be reconciled with any of the Evangelists, and this cannot be
reconciled with all of them.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Last of all he was seen of me
also.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s belief in the resurrection was based solely
upon Jesus&rsquo; supposed appearance to him; for the other alleged
appearances he had rejected. Not until he imagined that he had seen
Jesus did he believe that the disciples had seen him, and the
appearance of Jesus to him, which occurred several years after the
resurrection and ascension, is represented as an occurrence of exactly
the same character as his appearances to the disciples. Paul&rsquo;s
vision was clearly a delusion, and if so the other appearances,
measured by Paul&rsquo;s criterion, were delusions also. The Rev. John
W. Chadwick <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>truly says: &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s witness to the
resurrection is the ruin of the argument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matthew: In Galilee.</p>
<p>Luke: In Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Matthew says that when Mary Magdalene and the other Mary visited the
tomb an angel appeared to them and said: &ldquo;Go quickly, and tell
his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth
before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him&rdquo; (<a class=

and repeated the command: &ldquo;Go tell my brethren that they go into
Galilee, and there shall they see me&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:10">10</a>).
&ldquo;Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him they
worshiped him&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:13-35">xxiv,
13&ndash;35</a>) states that on the day of the resurrection Jesus
journeyed to Emmaus, a village some distance from Jerusalem, with
Cleopas and his companion. They did not recognize him until after their
arrival there, when they returned at once to Jerusalem and informed the
disciples. &ldquo;As they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst
of them&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:36">36</a>). He
conversed with them for a time, after which &ldquo;he led them out as
far as to Bethany&rdquo; where he took his final leave of them and
ascended to heaven (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:38-51">38&ndash;51</a>).
Instead of bidding them go to Galilee, a three days journey from
Jerusalem, as Matthew states, his command was &ldquo;Tarry <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>ye
in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on

title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:1-13">ii,
1&ndash;13</a>), was not until the day of Pentecost, seven weeks
later.</p>
<p>Matthew&rsquo;s narrative forbids the supposition of any meeting in
Judea, while Luke&rsquo;s precludes the possibility of a meeting in
Galilee.</p>
<p>Regarding this discrepancy Dean Alford says: &ldquo;We must be
content to walk by faith, and not by sight&rdquo; (Greek Testament, p.
905).</p>

<p>Threescore furlongs was seven and one-half Roman, or about seven
American miles. Emmaus of Judea was about twenty-five miles, or two
hundred furlongs from Jerusalem. There was an Emmaus in Galilee, about
seventy miles from Jerusalem. It is believed by some that the legend
related to the latter place and was subsequently transferred by Luke to
Judea.</p>

"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2021:14">John xxi,
14</a>).</p>
<p>According to the Evangelists Jesus rose, not from the
grave&mdash;not from the place where the bodies of the dead were
deposited&mdash;but from the lower world&mdash;from the realm of the
dead&mdash;where the shades of the departed were supposed to repose.
Regarding this Dr. Hooykaas says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us begin by considering what
that word &lsquo;resurrection&rsquo; really meant, whether applied to
Jesus or to others. Later representations, down to our own times, have
regarded it as equivalent to a rising from the grave; but the question
is, what it meant in the faith and preaching of the Apostles, in the
genuine, original, primitive tradition that Jesus had risen. Now,
&lsquo;resurrection&rsquo; means elsewhere a return from the realm of
shades to the human life on earth; and Jesus too had left the
underworld, but not, in this case, to return at once to life upon the
earth, but to be taken up provisionally into heaven. Originally the
resurrection and ascension of Jesus were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>one. It was only
later that the conception sprang up of his having paused upon earth,
whether for a single day or for several weeks, on his journey from the
abyss to the height.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We may, therefore, safely assert
that if the friends of Jesus had thought as we do of the lot of those
that die, they would never have so much as dreamed of their
Master&rsquo;s resurrection or ascension. For to the Christian belief
of today it would be, so to speak, a matter of course that Jesus, like
all good and noble souls&mdash;and indeed above all others&mdash;would
go straight &lsquo;to a better world,&rsquo; &lsquo;to heaven,&rsquo;
&lsquo;to God,&rsquo; at the instant of his death; but in the
conception of the Jews, including the Apostles, this was impossible.
Heaven was the abode of the Lord and his angels only; and if an Enoch
or an Elijah had been caught up there alive, to dwell there for a time,
it was certain that all who died, without exception, even the purest
and most holy, must go down as shades into the realms of the dead in
the bowels of the earth&mdash;and thence, of course, they would not
issue excepting by &lsquo;rising again<span class="corr" id="xd21e9823"
title="Not in source">.</span>&rsquo; And this is why we are never told
that Jesus rose &lsquo;from death,&rsquo; far less &lsquo;from the
grave,&rsquo; but always &lsquo;from the dead&rsquo;&rdquo; (Bible for
Learners, vol. iii, p. 463).</p>

<p class="first">Did his appearances indicate a corporeal, or merely a

<p>The Evangelists declare that he was not only seen by his disciples
and others, but that he conversed with them. Matthew says the two Marys
held him by the feet, Luke says he invited the disciples to handle him,
and John says that Thomas examined his wounds; while both Luke and John
state that he partook of nourishment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Luke says that while he sat at meat with Cleopas
and his companion at Emmaus &ldquo;He vanished out of their
sight&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:31">xxiv,

&ldquo;and stood in the midst&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

Eight days later the appearance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313"
href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>was repeated: &ldquo;Then
came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020:26">26</a>).
Mark says that after he appeared to Mary Magdalene &ldquo;he appeared
in another form&rdquo; to two of his disciples (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2016:12">xvi,
12</a>).</p>
<p>While the first named appearances can be reconciled with so-called
spiritual manifestations, the latter cannot be reconciled with a
corporeal existence.</p>
<p>In the preceding chapter we have shown that the alleged crucifixion
of Jesus is unworthy of belief. If he was not crucified the story of
his resurrection is, of course, a fiction. But conceding, for the sake
of argument, that he was crucified; does this make his resurrection
probable, or even possible? The crucifixion of a man is a possible
occurrence; but the corporeal resurrection of a man who has suffered
death is impossible. These reputed appearances of Jesus, if they have a
historical foundation, were evidently mere subjective impressions or
apparitions. Although he is declared to have remained on earth forty
days, he made, at the most, but two or three brief visits to his
disciples, appearing and disappearing like a phantom. Instead of
abiding with them, teaching them the doctrines of his religion&mdash;of
which they professed to be ignorant&mdash;and preparing them for their
coming ministry he is represented as keeping in seclusion, or roaming
aimlessly along the country highways, like some demented creature.
Referring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>to his appearance to his disciples, Jerome says:
&ldquo;The apostles supposed him to be a spirit, or according to the
Gospel which the Nazarenes receive [the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew] an
incorporeal demon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The possibility, and even prevalency, of apparitions similar to
those related of Jesus are recognized by every student of psychology.
Sir Benjamin Brodie, in his &ldquo;Psychological Inquiries&rdquo; (p.
78), says: &ldquo;There are abundant proofs that impressions may be
made in the brain by other causes simulating those which are made on it
by external objects through the medium of the organs of sense, thus
producing false perceptions, which may, in the first instance, and
before we have had time to reflect on the subject, be mistaken for
realities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene was not believed even by
the disciples. If the disciples believed that Mary was deluded, is it
unreasonable to believe that they were deluded also? Illusions are
contagious and may affect many minds as well as one. Dr. Carpenter, one
of the highest English authorities on mental science, says: &ldquo;If
not only a single individual, but several persons should be
&lsquo;possessed&rsquo; by one and the same idea or feeling, the same
misinterpretation may be made by all of them; and in such a case the
concurrence of their testimony does not add the least strength to
it&rdquo; (Principles of Mental Physiology, p. 208). In confirmation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>of this is cited the following from a work on
&ldquo;The Philosophy of Apparitions,&rdquo; by Dr. Hibbert, F.R.S.E.:
&ldquo;A whole ship&rsquo;s company was thrown into the utmost
consternation by the apparition of a cook who had died a few days
before. He was distinctly seen walking ahead of the ship, with a
peculiar gait by which he was distinguished when alive, through having
one of his legs shorter than the other. On steering the ship towards
the object, it was found to be a piece of floating wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These supposed appearances of Jesus were, at the most, only
apparitions, and &ldquo;Apparitions,&rdquo; to quote Dr. Hibbert again,
&ldquo;are nothing more than morbid symptoms, which are indicative of
an intense excitement of the renovated feelings of the mind&rdquo;
(Philosophy of Apparitions, p. 375).</p>
<p>Lord Amberley advances a psychological explanation of the reputed
appearances of Jesus from which I quote the following: &ldquo;Whatever
other qualities Jesus may have possessed or lacked, there can be no
question that he had one&mdash;that of inspiring in others a strong
attachment to himself. He had in his brief career surrounded himself
with devoted disciples; and he was taken from their midst in the full
bloom of his powers by a violent and early death. Now there are some
who have been taught by the bitter experience of their lives how
difficult, nay, how impossible it is to realize in imagination the fact
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>that a beloved companion is in truth gone from
them forever.... We fondly conceive that in some way the dead must
still exist; and if so, can one, who was so tender before, listen to
our cry of pain and refuse to come? Can one, who soothed us in the
lesser troubles of our lives, look on while we are suffering the
greatest agony of all and fail to comfort? It cannot be. Imagination
declines to picture the long future that lies before us. We cannot
understand that we shall never again listen to the tones of the
familiar voice; never feel the touch of the gentle hand; never be
encouraged by the warm embrace that tells us we are loved, or find a
refuge from miserable thoughts and the vexations of the world in the
affectionate and ever-open heart. All this is too hard for us. We long
for a resurrection; we should believe in it if we could; we do believe
in it in sleep, when our feelings are free to roam at pleasure,
unrestrained by the chilling presence of the material world. In dreams
the old life is repeated again and again. Sometimes the lost one is
beside us as of old and we are quite untroubled by the thought of
parting. Sometimes there is a strange and confusing consciousness that
the great calamity has happened, or has been thought to happen, but
that now we are again together, and that a new life has succeeded upon
death.... Granting only a strong emotion and a lively phantasy, we may
comprehend at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=

images of their dreams may also become the visions of their waking
hours&rdquo; (Analysis of Religious Belief, pp. 275, 276).</p>
<p>Renan says: &ldquo;For the historian, the life of Jesus finishes
with his last sigh. But such was the impression he had left in the
heart of his disciples, and of a few devoted women, that during some
weeks more it was as if he were living and consoling them. Had his body
been taken away, or did enthusiasm, always credulous, create afterwards
the group of narratives by which it was sought to establish faith in
the resurrection? In the absence of opposing documents this can never
be ascertained. Let us say, however, that the strong imagination of
Mary Magdalene played an important part in the circumstance. Divine
power of love! Sacred moments in which the passion of one possessed
gave to the world a resuscitated God&rdquo; (Life of Jesus, p.
296).</p>

<p>This is not a vital, but it is a pertinent question. It is stated
that he appeared to Mary Magdalene immediately after the resurrection.
Did he appear to her naked, or was he clothed? As she mistook him for
the gardener, and as the gardener undoubtedly went clad, it may be
presumed that Jesus was clad also. If so, where <span class=

<p class="first">What is said of the saints who arose on the day of the
crucifixion?</p>
<p>Matthew: They &ldquo;came out of the graves after the resurrection,
and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=

53</a>).</p>
<p>Before Matthew&rsquo;s wholesale resurrection of the saints the
resurrection of Jesus pales into insignificance. In the opinion of many
supernaturalists Matthew has mixed too large a dose of the miraculous
for even Christian credulity to swallow, and they would gladly omit
this portion of it. Regarding this story Dr. Farrar says: &ldquo;An
earthquake shook the earth and split the rocks, and as it rolled away
from their places the great stones which closed and covered the cavern
sepulchres of the Jews, so it seemed to the imaginations of many to
have disimprisoned the spirits of the dead, and to have filled the air
with ghostly visitants, who after Christ had risen appeared to linger
in the Holy City&rdquo; (Life of Christ, vol. ii, p. 419). Dean Milman
dismisses it in much the same way. Referring to the earthquake, he
says: &ldquo;The same convulsion would displace the stones which
covered the ancient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319"
name="pb319">319</a>]</span>tombs and lay open many of the innumerable
rock-hewn sepulchres which perforated the hills on every side of the
city, and expose the dead to public view. To the awe-struck and
depressed minds of the followers of Jesus, no doubt, were confined
these visionary appearances of the spirits of their deceased
brethren&rdquo; (History of Christianity, vol. i, p. 336).</p>
<p>If the minds of the disciples were so greatly affected that they
imagined they beheld the resurrected bodies of strangers whom they had
never met and of whom they had probably never heard&mdash;for they were
nearly a hundred miles from the graves of their own kindred&mdash;is it
strange that they should imagine they saw the resurrected Master with
whom they had daily associated for months and perhaps years? To
characterize these resurrected saints as &ldquo;ghostly
visitants&rdquo; and &ldquo;visionary appearances,&rdquo; and the
resurrected Christ as a real being, is a distinction without a
scintilla of evidence to support it. Both appearances, if they be
historical, belong to the same class of mental phenomena; and are,
indeed, the offspring of the same minds.</p>

<p>Matthew, after describing the death and burial of Jesus, says:
&ldquo;Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the
chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate.&rdquo; It is
generally conceded by Christian commentators that by &ldquo;the next
day&rdquo; Matthew refers to the Sabbath, for if Jesus was crucified
and buried on Friday, no other day can be meant. To avoid the
disagreeable consequences of such an admission a few have contended
that by &ldquo;the day of preparation&rdquo; is meant the Preparation
of the Passover. But this renders the passage unintelligible. By
&ldquo;preparation&rdquo; Matthew means, not the Preparation of the
Passover, but the preparation of the Sabbath. This is made clear by the
other Synoptics. After relating the events of the crucifixion, Mark
begins his account of the burial with these words: &ldquo;And now when
the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day
before the Sabbath&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2015:42">xv, 42</a>).
Luke, after giving an account of the crucifixion and burial, says:
&ldquo;And that day was the preparation and the Sabbath drew on&rdquo;

href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2023:54">xxiii,

<p>It is claimed by the Evangelists that the Jewish priests of that
period were such rigid observers of the Sabbath that they sought to put
Jesus to death for simply healing the sick on that <span class=

That the Sanhedrim desecrated the Sabbath, and especially the Passover

<p class="first">When was the guard placed at the tomb?</p>
<p>Matthew: <i>Not until the second night.</i></p>
<p>It is argued that Jesus must have risen because a guard was placed
at his tomb so that it was impossible for his disciples to &ldquo;come
by night, and steal him away.&rdquo; But had his body really been left
in the tomb, as claimed, they would have taken it the first night had
they desired it. The passage cited from Matthew in the preceding
criticism declares that a guard was not requested of Pilate until the
day following the crucifixion, so that the tomb was without a guard the
first night. The sepulchre was not opened and examined when the guard
was placed there on the following day. &ldquo;So they went and made the
sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2027:66">Matt.
xxvii, 66</a>). Had the seal been found unbroken at the end of three
days it would not have proved that Jesus&rsquo; body still remained in
the tomb. It would merely have proved that the body had not been
removed after the seal was placed on it.</p>
<p>It may be urged that Jesus had prophesied that he would not rise
until the third day, and that an earlier disappearance of the body
could not be harmonized with a strict fulfillment of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=

<p class="first">What is said in regard to the opening of the tomb?</p>
<p>Matthew: &ldquo;In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn
toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary to see the sepulchre. And behold there was a great earthquake; for
the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back
the stone from the door, and sat upon it.... And the angel answered and
said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which
was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see
the place where the Lord lay&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:1-6">xxviii,
1&ndash;6</a>).</p>
<p>Matthew&rsquo;s story of the guard was evidently inserted for the
express purpose of establishing a belief in the resurrection by making
it appear impossible for his friends to have removed the body from the
sepulchre. Yet this story suggests, if it does not prove, the very
thing that he attempts to prove impossible. The sepulchre was opened in
the presence of witnesses&mdash;the guards and the women. Jesus did not
emerge from it, nor did it contain his body. It was empty when opened.
This renders probable, if not certain, one of two things: either his
body was not deposited there, or it was removed before the watch was
set. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>Commenting on the empty tomb L. K. Washburn says: &ldquo;If Jesus
got out of the grave alive, he was put into it alive. If he was put
into it dead, he was taken out dead. A depopulated sepulchre is not
proof that its former tenant has moved to heaven. It is merely proof
that somebody has stolen a dead body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The penalty for sleeping while on duty was death, and no bribe could
have induced them to declare that they were guilty of this offense even
if the priests had promised to intercede for them. Again, had this
transaction really occurred it would have been known only by the
parties <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=

direst punishment to both the bribe-givers and the bribe-takers,
neither would have divulged the crime.</p>
<p>Strauss, criticising the alleged action of the Jewish priests, says:
&ldquo;Their conduct, when the guards returning from the grave apprised
them of the resurrection of Jesus, is truly impossible. They believe
the assertion of the soldiers that Jesus had arisen out of his grave in
a miraculous manner. How could the council, many of whose members were
Sadducees, receive this as credible? Even the Pharisees in the
Sanhedrim, though they held in theory the possibility of a
resurrection, would not, with the mean opinion they entertained of
Jesus, be inclined to believe in his resurrection, especially as the
assertion in the mouth of the guards sounded just like a falsehood
invented to screen a failure in duty. The real Sanhedrists, on hearing
such an assertion from the soldiers, would have replied with
exasperation: You lie! you have slept and allowed him to be stolen; but
you will have to pay dearly for this, when it comes to be investigated
by the procurator. But instead of this, the Sanhedrists in our gospel
speak them fair, and entreat them thus: Tell a lie, say that you have
slept and allowed him to be stolen; moreover, they pay them richly for
the falsehood, and promise to exculpate them to the procurator. This is
evidently spoken entirely on the Christian presupposition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>of
the reality of the resurrection of Jesus; a presupposition, however,
which is quite incorrectly attributed to the Sanhedrim&rdquo;

<p>Concerning this Greg says: &ldquo;That this definite form of baptism
proceeded from Jesus, is opposed by the fact that such an allocation of
the Father, Son, and Spirit, does not elsewhere appear, except as a
form of salutation in the epistles; while as a definite form of baptism
it is nowhere met with throughout the New Testament. Moreover, it was
not the form used, and could scarcely, therefore, have been the form
commanded; for in the apostolic epistles, and even in the Acts, the
form always is &lsquo;baptizing into Christ Jesus,&rsquo; or,
&lsquo;into the name of the Lord Jesus&rsquo;&rdquo; (Creed of
Christendom, p. 191).</p>
<p>This ecclesiastical formula was not adopted by the church until late
in the second century, and then, not for baptism, but for admission
into the church. In regard to this the Rev. Dr. Hooykaas says:
&ldquo;Baptism into the name of God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son of
God, and the Holy Spirit, means baptism into the confession of or faith
in these three, and is a short epitome of Christian doctrine of which
Jesus certainly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332"
name="pb332">332</a>]</span>never dreamed; nay, it is obvious from all
accounts that, even in the apostolic age, it was as yet quite unknown;
and the still later age which drew up the words by no means intended
them as a baptismal formula, but rather as a statement of the
conditions of admission into the community. In making the utterance of
these words, instead of the imposition of these conditions, the first
act of admission into the community of Christ, the Church has
confounded words with things&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, vol. iii, pp.
472, 473).</p>

<p>The whole theology of Paul is opposed to the bodily resurrection and

&ldquo;In speaking of the resurrection, he [Paul] does not mean the

a thought by ascribing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href=

spiritual body not made of flesh and blood. It is equally certain that
he thinks of the Christ as having appeared from heaven; and his ranking
the appearance to himself&mdash;unquestionably the product of his own
fervid imagination&mdash;as parallel with those which preceded it [his
appearances to the disciples], seems to indicate that they were all
visions alike&rdquo; (Vol. iii, p. 467).</p>

<p>In regard to the resurrection and ascension <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>Thomas Paine says: &ldquo;As to the account
given of his resurrection and ascension, it was the necessary
counterpart of his birth. His historians having brought him into the
world in a supernatural manner, were obliged to take him out again in
the same manner, or the first part of the story must have fallen to the
ground. The wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told
exceeds every thing that went before it. The first part, that of the
miraculous conception, was not a thing that admitted of publicity; and
therefore the tellers of this part of the story had this advantage,
that though they might not be credited, they could not be detected....
But the resurrection of a dead person from the grave, and his ascension
through the air, is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits
of, to the invisible conception of a child in the womb. The
resurrection and ascension, supposing them to have taken place,
admitted of public and ocular demonstration, like that of the ascension
of a balloon, or the sun at noon-day, to all Jerusalem at least. A
thing which everybody is required to believe, requires that the proof
and evidence of it should be equal to all, and universal; and as the
public visibility of this last related act was the only evidence that
could give sanction to the former part, the whole of it falls to the
ground, because that evidence never was given.... It is in vain to
attempt to palliate or disguise this matter. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>story, so far as relates to the supernatural
part, has every mark of fraud and imposition stamped upon the face of
it. Who were the authors of it is as impossible for us now to know, as
it is for us to be assured that the books in which the account is
related were written by the persons whose names they bear; the best
surviving evidence we now have respecting this affair is the Jews. They
are regularly descended from the people who lived in the times this
resurrection and ascension is said to have happened, and they say, it
is not true. It has long appeared to me a strange inconsistency to cite
the Jews as a proof of the truth of the story. It is just the same as
if a man were to say, I will prove the truth of what I have told you by
producing the people who say it is false&rdquo; (Age of Reason, pp. 10,
11).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The story of Jesus Christ
appearing after he was dead is the story of an apparition, such as
timid imaginations can always create in vision, and credulity
believe&rdquo; (Ibid, 161).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Supernatural Religion&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;The whole of the evidence for the Resurrection reduces itself to
an undefined belief on the part of a few persons, in a notoriously
superstitious age, that after Jesus had died and been buried they had
seen him alive. These visions, it is admitted, occurred at a time of
the most intense religious excitement, and under circumstances of
wholly exceptional mental agitation and distress. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>wildest alternations of fear, doubt, hope and
indefinite expectation, added their effects to oriental imaginations
already excited by indignation at the fate of their Master, and sorrow
or despair at such a dissipation of their Messianic dreams. There was
present every element of intellectual and moral disturbance. Now must
we seriously ask again whether this bare and wholly unjustified belief
can be accepted as satisfactory evidence for so astounding a miracle as
the Resurrection? Can the belief of such men, in such an age, establish
the reality of a phenomenon which is contradicted by universal
experience? We have no evidence as to what actually occurred. We do not
even know the facts upon which they based their inferences. We only
know that they thought they had seen Jesus and that they, therefore,
concluded that he had risen from the dead. It comes to us as bare
belief from the Age of Miracles, unsupported by facts, uncorroborated
by evidence, unaccompanied by proof of investigation, and unprovided
with material for examination. What is such belief worth? We have no
hesitation in saying that it is absolutely worth nothing&rdquo; (pp.
1048, 1049).</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Phillip Schaff, one of the most eminent evangelical
Christian scholars of this country, in his &ldquo;History of the
Christian Church,&rdquo; makes this candid admission regarding the
resurrection and ascension of Christ: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Truth compels us to admit that
there are serious difficulties in harmonizing the accounts of the
Evangelists, and in forming a consistent conception of Christ&rsquo;s
resurrection body hovering as it were between heaven and earth, and a
supernatural state, of a body clothed with flesh and blood and bearing
the wound prints, and yet so spiritual as to appear and disappear
through closed doors and to ascend visibly to heaven.&rdquo;

<p>Mark: He was the son of man.</p>
<p>Matthew and Luke: He was the Son of God.</p>
<p>John: He was God himself.</p>
<p>In the Four Gospels are presented three entirely different
conceptions of the Christ. In Mark he is represented as the son of
human parents&mdash;the Messiah&mdash;but simply a man. In Matthew and
Luke we have the story of the miraculous conception&mdash;he is
represented as the Son of God. In John he is declared to be God
himself. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word [Christ], and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=

<p>According to Mark Christ is a man; according to Matthew and Luke, a
demi-god; according to John, a God.</p>
<p>Voltaire thus harmonizes these discordant conceptions: &ldquo;The
son of God is the same as the son of man; the son of man is the same as
the son of God. God, the father, is the same as Christ, the son;
Christ, the son, is the same as God, the father. This language may
appear confused <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341"
name="pb341">341</a>]</span>to unbelievers, but Christians will readily
understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is quite as intelligible as the Christian Confession of Faith,
Article II of which reads as follows: &ldquo;The Son, which is the Word
of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and
eternal God, and of one substance with the Father, took man&rsquo;s
nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two
whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood,
were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof is one
Christ, very God, and very Man.&rdquo;</p>

of God, and God with the limitations and weaknesses of
man.&rdquo;&mdash;Ingersoll.</p>

<p class="first">Is the doctrine of the Trinity taught in the New
Testament?</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For there are three that bear
record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these
three are one&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%205:7">1 John v,
7</a>).</p>
<p>This is the only passage in the New Testament which clearly teaches
the doctrine of the Trinity, and this passage is admitted by all
Christian scholars to be an interpolation.</p>
<p>When the modern version of the New Testament was first published by
Erasmus it was criticised because it contained no text teaching the
doctrine of the Trinity. Erasmus promised his critics that if a
manuscript could be found containing such a text he would insert it.
The manuscript was &ldquo;found,&rdquo; and the text quoted appeared in
a later edition. Concerning this interpolation Sir Isaac Newton, in a
letter to a friend, which was afterward published by Bishop Horsley,
says: &ldquo;When the adversaries of Erasmus had got the Trinity into
his edition, they threw by their manuscript as an old almanac out of
date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alluding to the doctrine of the Trinity, Thomas Jefferson says:
&ldquo;It is too late in the day for men of sincerity to pretend they
believe in the Platonic mysticism that three are one and one is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>three, and yet, that the one is not three, and
the three not one.... But this constitutes the craft, the power, and
profits of the priests. Sweep away their gossamer fabrics of fictitious
religion, and they would catch no more flies&rdquo; (Jefferson&rsquo;s
Works, vol. iv, p. 205, Randolph&rsquo;s ed.).</p>
<p>Again Jefferson says: &ldquo;The hocus-pocus phantasm of a God, like
another Cerberus, with one body and three heads, had its birth and
growth in the blood of thousands and thousands of martyrs&rdquo; (Ibid,
p. 360).</p>

<p>The Holy Ghost (Spirit), as was noted in a previous chapter, was

The Gospel According to the Hebrews, which, it is claimed, was the
original Gospel of Matthew, represented Jesus as saying, &ldquo;Just
now my mother, the Holy Ghost, laid hold on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the Holy Ghost was the mother of Jesus did he have two mothers?
According to our Greek version of Matthew, as well as that of Luke, he
had one mother and three reputed fathers&mdash;God, the Holy Ghost, and
Joseph.</p>

<p>It is not. Matthew and Mark say: &ldquo;Is not his mother called

sisters, are they not all with us?&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"

<p>To maintain this dogma it is affirmed that by &ldquo;brethren and

in regard to most disputed points, assumes a non-committal or
conciliatory attitude, concedes that &ldquo;the natural supposition
that, after the miraculous conception of our Lord, Joseph and Mary
lived together in the married state, and that James, and Joses, and
Judas, and Simon, with daughters, whose names are not recorded, were
subsequently born to them,&rdquo; is &ldquo;in accordance certainly

<p>To believe that a Jewish virgin was overshadowed by a spirit, and
miraculously conceived and bore a child, requires more convincing proof
than the dream of a credulous lover. We ought at least to have the
testimony of the mother. But we have it not. She testifies that Joseph

ancient versions, Jerome as well as the rest, read, &lsquo;Great is the
mystery of godliness, which was manifest in the flesh.&rsquo; Our
English version makes it yet a little stronger. It reads, &lsquo;Great
is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the
flesh.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion Newton says: &ldquo;If the ancient churches, in
debating and deciding the greatest mysteries of religion, knew nothing
of these two texts, I understand not why we should be so fond of them
now the debate is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Supernatural Religion&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;The supposed miraculous evidence for the divine revelation,
moreover, is without any special divine character, being avowedly
common also to Satanic agency, but it is not original either in
conception or details. Similar miracles to those which are supposed to
attest it are reported long antecedent to the promulgation of
Christianity, and continued to be performed for centuries after it. A
stream of miraculous pretension, in fact, has flowed through all human
history, deep and broad as it has passed through the darker ages, but
dwindling down to a thread as it has entered days of enlightenment. The
evidence was too hackneyed and commonplace to make any impression upon
those before whom the Christian miracles are said to have been
performed, and it altogether failed to convince the people to whom the
revelation was primarily addressed. The selection of such evidence, for
such a purpose, is much more characteristic of human weakness than of
divine power&rdquo; (p. 699).</p>
<p>Archbishop Trench says: &ldquo;Side by side with the miracles which
serve for the furthering of the kingdom of God runs another line of
wonders, the counter-workings of him who is ever the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>ape
of the Most High.... This fact that the kingdom of lies has its wonders
no less than the kingdom of truth, is itself sufficient evidence that
miracles cannot be appealed to absolutely and finally, in proof of the
doctrine which the worker of them proclaims&rdquo; (Miracles of Our
Lord, p. 22).</p>
<p>The miracles of Christ, like the miracles of Satan, existed only in
the minds of his credulous and deluded followers.</p>

<p class="first">Prophecy is appealed to in support of his divinity. It
is claimed that the writers of the Old Testament predicted his coming.
Do such predictions exist?</p>
<p>In his work on &ldquo;The Bible,&rdquo; as well as in a previous
chapter of this work, the writer has shown that there is not a single
passage in the Old Testament that, in the original text, refers in the
remotest degree to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Greg shows that much of Old Testament history, like Deuteronomy, is
presented in the form of anticipatory narrative. To the Christian
argument that the Messianic predictions, at least, were written long
anterior to the time of Christ, he replies: &ldquo;This is true, and
the argument would have all the force which is attributed to it, were
the objectors able to lay their fingers on a single <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>Old
Testament prediction clearly referring to Jesus Christ, intended by the
utterers of it to relate to him, prefiguring his character and career,
and manifestly fulfilled in his appearance on earth. This they cannot
do. Most of the passages usually adduced as complying with these
conditions, referred, and were clearly intended to refer, to eminent
individuals in Israelitish history; many are not prophecies at all; the
Messiah, the anointed deliverer, expected by the Jews, hoped for and
called for by their poets and prophets, was of a character so
different, and a career so opposite, to those of the meek, lowly,
long-suffering Jesus, that the passages describing the one never could
have been applied to the other, without a perversion of ingenuity, and
a disloyal treatment of their obvious signification, which, if employed
in any other field than that of theology, would have met with the
prompt discredit and derision they deserve&rdquo; (Creed of
Christendom, pp. 135, 136).</p>

rendered nugatory by the fact that the book containing it was not
composed until a hundred years after the destruction of the temple.</p>

<p>Like nearly all the doctrines ascribed to Christ, the atonement is
in the highest degree unjust and absurd. Referring to this doctrine,
Lord Byron says: &ldquo;The basis of your religion is injustice. The
Son of God, the pure, the immaculate, the innocent, is sacrificed for
the guilty. This proves his heroism, but no more does away with
man&rsquo;s sin than a schoolboy&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

flogged for another would exculpate a dunce from negligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greg justly charges Christians with &ldquo;holding the strangely
inconsistent doctrine that God is so just that he could not let sin go
unpunished, yet so unjust that he could punish it in the person of the
innocent.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is for orthodox dialectics,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;to explain how Divine Justice can be impugned by pardoning the
guilty, and yet vindicated by punishing the innocent!&rdquo; (Creed of
Christendom, pp. 338, 339.)</p>

<p>Hon. Allan L. McDermott, in his memorable speech in Congress, in
1906, protesting against the persecution of Jews by Christians, said:
&ldquo;If an omnipotent God orders anything done, the human instruments
selected to carry out his orders cannot be charged with the acts
commanded. The doctrine of repondeat superior applies. If what happened
could have been prevented by the Romans or by the Jews, then the New
Testament is worthless. Let us assume that the Jews crucified Christ.
Could they have done otherwise? Were they greater than God? According
to the Bible, the crucifixion was arranged for by the Father. Why blame
the Jews or the Romans or any other mortals? They did not know what
they were doing. The Roman soldiers did not believe that they were
crucifying the son of God; they did not know they were crucifying God
himself. Why blame the instruments? Why persecute the descendants?
According to the Synoptic Gospels and according to John, the
arrangements for the crucifixion&mdash;every detail&mdash;were made by
Almighty God, and were known to Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter states that &ldquo;his soul was not left in hell,&rdquo; which
necessitates the assumption of his having gone there. He also declares
that after his death he &ldquo;went and preached unto the spirits in

&ldquo;To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth

"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%204:5">Romans iv,

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%203:28">iii,

<p>James: &ldquo;But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without
works is dead?&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jam%202:20">ii, 20</a>).
&ldquo;Ye see, then, how that by works a man is justified, and not by
faith only&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jam%202:24">24</a>).</p>
<p>The church accepts the teachings of Paul and condemns or ignores the
teachings of James. Martin Luther, in his &ldquo;Table Talk,&rdquo;
thus defines the position of the Protestant church: &ldquo;He that says
the gospel requires works for salvation, I say flat and plain he is a
liar.&rdquo; &ldquo;Every doer of the law and every moral worker is
accursed, for he walketh in the presumption of his own
righteousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;If men only believe enough in Christ they
can commit adultery and murder a thousand <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>times a day without
periling their salvation.&rdquo; Luther rejected and denounced the book
of James because it teaches the efficacy of good works.</p>
<p>The English &ldquo;Confession of Faith&rdquo; affirms the following:
&ldquo;That we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholesome
doctrine, and very full of comfort&rdquo; (Art. XI). &ldquo;Works done
before the grace of Christ, and the inspiration of the Spirit, are not
pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus
Christ.... Yea rather, for that they are not done as God hath willed
and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of
sin&rdquo; (Art. XIII).</p>

<p>A demand so preposterous could have been made only in support of
claims that were realized to be untenable. Credulity was appealed to
because convincing evidence could not be adduced. Claims which reason
rejects are manifestly false, and it is only by a renunciation of
reason that they can be accepted as true.</p>
<p>The absurdity of this requirement of Christ is thus exposed by the
poet Shelley: &ldquo;This is the pivot upon which all religions turn;
they all assume that it is in our power to believe or not to believe:
whereas the mind can only believe that which it thinks true. A human
being can only be supposed accountable for those actions which are
influenced by his will. But belief is utterly distinct from and
unconnected with volition: it is the apprehension of the agreement or
disagreement of the ideas that compose any proposition. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>Belief is a passion or involuntary operation of
the mind, and, like other passions, its intensity is precisely
proportionate to the degree of excitement. Volition is essential to
merit or demerit. But the Christian religion attaches the highest
possible degree of merit and demerit to that which is worthy of
neither, and which is totally unconnected with the peculiar faculty of
the mind whose presence is essential to their being&rdquo; (Notes to
Queen Mab).</p>

<p>This doctrine of forgiveness of sin is a premium on crime.
&ldquo;Forgive us our sins&rdquo; means &ldquo;Let us continue in our

of the most fruitful sources of immorality. It has been the chief cause
of making Christian nations the most immoral of nations. In teaching
this doctrine Christ committed a sin for which his death did not atone,
and which can never be forgiven. There is no forgiveness of sin. Every
cause has its effect; every sinner must suffer the consequences of his
sins.</p>

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2016:16">Mark xvi,
16</a>).</p>
<p>These words, while appearing in the unauthentic appendix to Mark,
yet express clearly the alleged teachings of Jesus. Above all they have
formed the key note of orthodox Christianity in all ages of the
church.</p>
<p>Between the lines of this passage the eye of the unfettered mind
discerns in large capitals the word FRAUD. These words are the words of
an impostor. Had Jesus been divine he would not have been compelled to
resort to bribes and threats to secure the world&rsquo;s adherence. Had
he even been a sincere man he would not have desired converts on such
terms. These words are either the utterance of a false Messiah,
conscious of his impotency, or the invention of priests who intended
them to frighten the ignorant and credulous into an acceptance of their
faith.</p>
<p>Concerning this teaching Col. Ingersoll says: &ldquo;Redden your
hands with human blood; blast by slander the fair fame of the innocent;
strangle the smiling child upon its mother&rsquo;s knees; deceive,
ruin, and desert the beautiful girl who loves and trusts you, and your
case is not hopeless. For all this, and for all these, you may be
forgiven. For all this, and for all these, that bankrupt court
established by the gospel will give you a discharge; but deny the
existence of these divine ghosts, of these gods, and the sweet and
tearful face of Mercy becomes livid with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Heaven&rsquo;s golden gates are shut, and you, with an infinite curse
ringing in your ears, with the brand of infamy upon your brow, commence
your endless wanderings in the lurid gloom of hell&mdash;an immortal
vagrant, an eternal outcast, a deathless convict.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A gloomy heaven above opening its

And below an inexorable Hell expanding its leviathan jaws for the vast

<p>That is the most infamous passage in all literature. It is the
language, not of an incarnate God, but of an incarnate devil. The being
who gave utterance to those words deserves not the worship, but the
execration of mankind. The priests who preach this doctrine of eternal
pain are fiends. There is misery enough in this world without adding to
it the mental anguish of this monstrous lie.</p>
<p>Less than a hundred years ago, when Christ was yet believed to be
divine, in nearly every pulpit, to frighten timid and confiding
mothers, dimpled babes were consigned to the red flames of this eternal
hell. Then came the preachers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374"
href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>of humanity&mdash;the
Ballous, the Channings, the Parkers and the Beechers&mdash;preachers
with hearts and brains, who sought to humanize this heavenly demon, to
make of him a decent man, and civilize his fiendish priests. To these
men is due the debt of everlasting gratitude. With the return of every
spring the emancipated of the race should build above their sacred dust
a pyramid of flowers.</p>
<p>Not by the sects known as Universalists and Unitarians, small in
numbers, though in the character of their adherents the greatest of the
Christian sects, must we estimate the importance of the work of Ballou
and Channing and other Liberal ministers. The influence of their
teachings has permeated every Christian sect, and quickened every
humane conscience. In the minds of all intelligent Christians, largely
as the result of their labors, this heartless demon and this cruel
dogma are dead. In their creeds they still survive. They are ashamed of
the dogma; they abhor it. They should abhor its author, and banish
both.</p>

prayer?</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All things whatsoever ye shall ask
in prayer, believing, ye shall receive&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2021:22">Matthew xxi,
22</a>).</p>
<p>This is one of the cardinal doctrines of his religion. He is
continually impressing upon the minds of his hearers the necessity and
the efficacy of prayer. Referring to this doctrine, Greg says:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This doctrine has in all ages been
a stumbling block to the thoughtful. It is obviously irreconcilable
with all that reason and revelation teach us of the divine nature; and
the inconsistency has been felt by the ablest of the Scripture writers
themselves. Various and desperate have been the expedients and
suppositions resorted to, in order to reconcile the conception of an
immutable, all-wise, all-foreseeing God, with that of a father who is
turned from his course by the prayers of his creatures. But all such
efforts are, and are felt to be, hopeless failures. They involve the
assertion and negation of the same proposition in one breath. The
problem remains still insoluble; and we must either be content to leave
it so, or we must abandon one or other of the hostile premises.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The religious man, who believes
that all events, mental as well as physical, are pre-ordered and
arranged according to the decrees of infinite wisdom, and the
philosopher, who knows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href=
"#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>that, by the wise and eternal laws
of the universe, cause and effect are indissolubly chained together,
and that one follows the other in inevitable succession&mdash;equally
feel that this ordination&mdash;this chain&mdash;cannot be changed at
the cry of man. To suppose that it can is to place the whole harmonious
system of nature at the mercy of the weak reason and the selfish wishes
of humanity. If the purposes of God were not wise, they would not be
formed: if wise, they cannot be changed, for then they would become
unwise. To suppose that an all-wise Being would alter his designs and
modes of proceeding at the entreaty of an unknowing creature, is to
believe that compassion would change his wisdom into foolishness.... If
the universe is governed by fixed laws, or (which is the same
proposition in different language), if all events are pre-ordained by
the foreseeing wisdom of an infinite God, then the prayers of thousands
of years and generations of martyrs and saints cannot change or modify
one iota of our destiny. The proposition is unassailable by the
subtlest logic. The weak, fond affections of humanity struggle in vain
against the unwelcome conclusion&rdquo; (Creed of Christendom, pp. 322,
323).</p>

<p>The proneness of Christ&rsquo;s followers to neglect his ordinances
and precepts which require some sacrifice or effort to obey, and the
readiness with which they observe those which do not, find a fitting
illustration in the reception accorded these teachings. While the early
Christians, many of them, accepted the first as a religious obligation
not to be violated, the second was ignored. Writing of Christian monks
and nuns, Lecky says: &ldquo;The cleanliness of the body was regarded
as a pollution of the soul, and the saints who were most admired had
become one hideous mass of clotted filth. St. Athanasius relates with
enthusiasm how St. Antony, the patriarch of monachism, had never, to
extreme old age, been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href=

Abraham the hermit, however, who lived for fifty years after his
conversion, rigidly refused from that date to wash either his face or
feet.... St. Euphraxia joined a convent of one hundred and thirty nuns,
who never washed their feet, and who shuddered at the mention of a
bath&rdquo; (European Morals, Vol. II, pp. 109, 110).</p>

<p>John: &ldquo;There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee.... And both
Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. And when they
wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine....
And there were set there six water pots of stone, ... containing two or
three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the water pots with
water. And they filled them up to the brim&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%202:1-7">ii,
1&ndash;7</a>). This water he turned into wine.</p>
<p>Here is Christ supplying a party already &ldquo;well drunk&rdquo;
with more than one hundred gallons of wine. As they were intoxicated
when he performed the miracle, would it not have been better for them
and better for the millions who have accepted him as a moral guide, if
at the beginning of the feast he had turned the wine into water?</p>
<p>The morality taught by Jesus suffers in comparison with that taught
by Mohammed. Mohammed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href=
"#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>prohibited the use of intoxicating
drink, and the Mohammedans are a temperate people; Jesus sanctioned the
use of intoxicating drink, and the Christian world abounds with
drunkenness.</p>
<p>Referring to the miracle at Cana, Strauss says: &ldquo;Not only,
however, has the miracle been impeached in relation to possibility, but
also in relation to utility and fitness. It has been urged both in
ancient and modern times, that it was unworthy of Jesus that he should
not only remain in the society of drunkards, but even further their
intemperance by an exercise of his miraculous power&rdquo; (<span lang=

doctoring dogs? Would you like him as a family physician? Do you think
that, even if he were to cure the child then, he would have done a

Jerusalem with his parents, he allows them to depart for home without

the trouble he has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392"

<p class="first">What did he require of his disciples?</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If any man come to me, and hate
not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren and
sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple&rdquo;

xiv, 26</a>).</p>
<p>It is scarcely possible in this age of enlightenment and unbelief to
realize what sorrows and miseries these accursed teachings of Christ
once caused. The eminent historian Lecky, in his &ldquo;History of
European Morals,&rdquo; has attempted to describe some of their awful
consequences. From his pages I quote the following:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To break by his ingratitude the
heart of the mother who had borne him, to persuade the wife who adored
him that it was her duty to separate from him forever, to abandon his
children, uncared for and beggars, to the mercies of the world, was
regarded by the true hermit as the most acceptable offering he could
make to his God. His business was to save his own soul. The serenity of
his devotion would be impaired by the discharge of the simplest duties
to his family. Evagrius, when a hermit in the desert, received, after a
long interval, letters from his father and mother. He could not bear
that the equable tenor of his thought should be disturbed by the
recollection of those who loved him, so he cast the letters unread into
the fire. A man named Mutius, accompanied by his only child, a little
boy of eight years old, abandoned his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>possessions and
demanded admission into a monastery. The monks received him, but they
proceeded to discipline his heart. &lsquo;He had already forgotten that
he was rich; he must next be taught to forget that he was a
father.&rsquo; His little child was separated from him, clothed in
rags, subjected to every form of gross and wanton hardship, beaten,
spurned and ill-treated. Day after day the father was compelled to look
upon his boy wasting away with sorrow, his once happy countenance
forever stained with tears, distorted by sobs of anguish. But yet, says
the admiring biographer, &lsquo;though he saw this day by day, such was
his love for Christ, and for the virtue of obedience, that the
father&rsquo;s heart was rigid and unmoved&rsquo; (Vol. ii, 125,
126).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He [St. Simeon Stylites] had been
passionately loved by his parents, and, if we may believe his eulogist
and biographer, he began his saintly career by breaking the heart of
his father, who died of grief at his flight. His mother, however,
lingered on. Twenty-seven years after his disappearance, at a period
when his austerities had made him famous, she heard for the first time
where he was and hastened to visit him. But all her labor was in vain.
No woman was admitted within the precincts of his dwelling, and he
refused to permit her even to look upon his face. Her entreaties and
tears were mingled with words of bitter and eloquent reproach.
&lsquo;My son,&rsquo; she is represented as having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>said, &lsquo;why have you done this? I bore you
in my womb, and you have wrung my soul with grief. I gave you milk from
my breast, you have filled my eyes with tears. For the kisses I gave
you, you have given me the anguish of a broken heart; for all that I
have done and suffered for you, you have repaid me by the most cruel
wrongs.&rsquo; At last the saint sent a message to her to tell her that
she would soon see him. Three days and three nights she had wept and
entreated in vain, and now, exhausted with grief and age and privation,
she sank feebly to the ground and breathed her last sigh before that
inhospitable door. Then for the first time the saint, accompanied by
his followers, came out. He shed some pious tears over the corpse of
his murdered mother, and offered up a prayer consigning her soul to
heaven&rdquo; (Ibid, 130).</p>

<p>Regarding these abusive epithets of Christ, Prof. Newman says:
&ldquo;The Jewish nation may well complain that they have been cruelly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>slandered by the gospels. The invectives have
been burnt into the heart of Christendom, so that the innocent Jews,
children of the dispersion, have felt in millennial misery&mdash;yes,
and to this day feel&mdash;the deadly sting of these fierce and haughty
utterances&rdquo; (Jesus Christ, p. 25).</p>

<p>Luke: &ldquo;And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to
dine with him; and he went in, and sat down to meat. And when the
Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed before
dinner. And the Lord said unto him, now do ye Pharisees make clean the

ravening and wickedness. Ye fools ... hypocrites!&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>Was such insolence of manners on the part of Jesus calculated to
promote the interest of the cause he professed to hold so dear at
heart? Supposing a Freethinker were to receive an invitation to dine
with a Christian friend and were to repay the hospitality of his host
with rudeness and abuse, interrupting the ceremony of
&ldquo;grace&rdquo; with an oath or a sneer, and showering upon the
head of his friend such epithets as &ldquo;hypocrite&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fool.&rdquo; Would such insolent behavior have a tendency to
gain for him the world&rsquo;s esteem or aid the cause he represents?
And are we to approve in a God conduct that <span class=

order to exhibit his divine character to assume the manners of a

<p class="first">Do the Pharisees deserve the sweeping condemnation
heaped upon them by Christ and his followers?</p>
<p>In marked contrast to the diatribes of Jesus is the testimony of
Josephus: &ldquo;Now, for the Pharisees, they live meanly [plainly],
and despise delicacies in diet, and they follow the conduct of reason;
and what that prescribes to them as good for them, they do; and they
think they ought earnestly to strive to observe reason&rsquo;s dictates
for practice.... The cities give great attestations to them on account
of their entire virtuous conduct, both in the actions of their lives,
and their discourses also&rdquo; (Antiquities, Book xviii, chap. i,
sec. 3).</p>

that he had been a Pharisee (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>No currency but the Jewish was accepted in the temple, while doves,

performed the very necessary office of supplying the Jews with

<p class="first">Describe the cursing of the fig tree.</p>
<p>Matthew: &ldquo;Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he
hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit
grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered

<p>Jesus cursed a living tree and it died; Mohammed blessed a dead tree
and it lived.</p>
<p>The alleged conduct of Jesus on many occasions, notably his harsh
treatment of his mother, his abuse of the Pharisees, his purging the
temple and his cursing the fig tree, is not the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>conduct of a rational being, but rather that of
a madman. If these stories be historical they would indicate that he
was not wholly responsible for his words and acts. Dr. Jules Soury, of
the University of France, believes that he was the victim of an
incurable mental disorder. In a work on morbid psychology, entitled
&ldquo;Studies on Jesus and The Gospels,&rdquo; Dr. Soury cites a long
array of seemingly indisputable facts in support of his theory. From
his preface to the work, I quote the following:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Jesus the God, gone down in his
glory, like a star sunk beneath the horizon but still shedding a few
faint rays on the world, threw a halo round the brow of Jesus the
Prophet. In the dull glow of that twilight, in the melancholy but
charming hour when everything seemed wrapped in vague, ethereal tints,
Jesus appeared to Strauss and Renan such as he had shown himself to his
first disciples, the Master par-excellence, a man truly divine. Then
came the night; and as darkness descended on those flickering gospel
beginnings there remained nought to be descried through the obscurity
of dubious history, but dimly looming, the portentous outline of the
gibbet and its victim.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In the present work Jesus makes
his appearance, perhaps for the first time, as a sufferer from a grave
malady, the course of which we have attempted to trace.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The nervous, or cerebral disorder,
at first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>congestive and then inflammatory, under which he
labored, was not only deep-seated and dangerous&mdash;it was incurable.
Among us at the present time that affection may be seen daily making
kings, millionaires, popes, prophets, saints, and even divinities of
poor fellows who have lost their balance; it has produced more than one
Messiah.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If we be right in the
interpretation of data which has been followed in the study of morbid
psychology, Jesus, at the time of his death, was in a somewhat advanced
stage of this disorder, He was, to all appearance, cut off opportunely;
the gibbet saved him from actual madness.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The diagnosis which we have
ventured to draw is based on three sets of facts which are attested by
the most ancient and trustworthy of the witnesses of his career.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;1. Religious excitement, then
general in Palestine, drove Jesus to the wilderness, where he lived
some time the life of a recluse, as those who considered themselves to
have the prophetic mission often did. Carried away with the idea that
he was divinely inspired to proclaim the coming of the Messiah, he left
his own people and his native place, and, attended by a following of
fishermen and others of the same class, went about among the towns and
villages of Galilee announcing the speedy approach of the Kingdom of
Heaven.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;2. After having proclaimed the
coming of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>the Messiah, like other contemporary Jewish
prophets, Jesus gradually came to look upon himself as the Messiah, the
Christ. He allowed himself to be called the Son of David, the Son of
God, and had among his followers one, if not more, of those fanatical
Sicarii, so graphically described by Josephus, who were waiting for the
deliverance of Israel from the yoke of Rome. Progressive obliteration
of the consciousness of his personal identity marks the interval
between the somewhat vague revelation which he made to his disciples at
the foot of Mount Hermon and the day when, before Caiaphas and before
Pilate, he openly declared that he was the Messiah, and by that token
the King of the Jews.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;3. The cursing of the fig tree
whereon there were no figs, because &lsquo;the time of figs was not
yet,&rsquo; the violent conduct toward the dealers and changers at the
temple, were manifestly foolish acts. Jesus had come to believe that
everything was permitted him, that all things belonged to him, that
nothing was too hard for him to do. For a long time he had given
evident signs of perversion of the natural affections, especially with
respect to his mother and brethren. To the fits of anger against the
priests and religious ministers of his nation, to the ambitious
extravagance of his words and acts, to the wild dream of his Messianic
grandeur, there rapidly supervened a characteristic depression of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>mental faculties and strength, a giving way of
the intellectual and muscular powers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Each of those periods in the
career of Jesus corresponds to a certain pathological state of his
nervous system.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;By reacting on the heart, the
religious excitement he labored under and the attendant functional
exacerbations had the immediate effect of accelerating the circulation,
unduly dilating the blood vessels, and producing cerebral
congestion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Chronic congestion of the brain,
subjectively considered, is always attended in the initial stage with
great increase of the moral consciousness, extraordinary activity of
the imagination, often leading to hallucinations, and later on with
absurdly exaggerated, frequently delirious ideas of power and
greatness. That stage is also usually characterized by irritability and
fits of passion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Objectively considered what is
observable is hypertrophy of the cellules and nerve-tubes, excessive
cerebral plethora and vascularity due to the great efflux of blood and
superabundant nutrition of the encephalon. Inflammation of the
meningeal covering, and of the brain itself, is, sooner or later, a
further result of the chronic congestion. The vessels, turgid and
loaded with blood, permit the transudation of the blood globules; the
circulation becomes impeded, then arrested, with the result of
depriving the cortical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href=
"#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>cerebral substance of arterial
blood, which is its life; the histological elements undergo alteration,
degenerate, become softened, and as the disorganization proceeds are
finally reduced to inert detritus.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The brain may remain capable more
or less well of performing its functions when deprived to a large
extent of its necessary food, but not so when the cerebral cellules are
disorganized. Dementia consequently is the natural sequel of the
congestive stage. To the destruction of the cortical substance
supervenes partial or total loss of consciousness, according to the
extent of the lesion. Such portions of the encephalon as continue
capable of performing any duty being in a state of hyperaemia, there is
often delirium more or less intense up to the last.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The process of the disorder is
irregular; remissions occur during which the reasoning faculties seem
to be recovered. But whether the duration extends only to a few months
or to several years, the increasing weakness of the patient, the
intellectual and muscular decay, the cachetic state into which he
falls, the lesions of other organs performing essential functions which
ensue, bring life to a close, and frequently without suffering.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This is how Jesus would have ended
had he been spared the violent death of the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly all the religious founders have been affected, to a greater
or less extent, with insanity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404"
href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>Genius itself is closely
allied to insanity&mdash;is indeed, in many cases, a form of insanity.
Moreau de Tours in his &ldquo;<span lang="fr">La Psychologie
Morbide</span>&rdquo; (p. 234) says: &ldquo;The mental disposition
which causes a man to be distinguished from his fellows by the
originality of his mind and conceptions, by his eccentricity, and the
energy of his affective faculties, or by the transcendence of his
intelligence, take their rise in the very same organic conditions which
are the source of the various mental perturbations whereof insanity and
idiocy are the most complete expressions.&rdquo; Buddha, Mohammed, and
probably Jesus, united with certain strong mental and moral
characteristics, a form of insanity which manifested itself in a sort
of religious madness&mdash;a madness that was contagious and which has
attacked and afflicted the greater portion of the human race.</p>

<p class="first">Did he not teach the doctrine of demoniacal possession
and exorcism?</p>
<p>Synoptics: He did.</p>
<p>After alluding to the prevalency of superstition among the Jews of
this period, Renan says: &ldquo;Jesus on this point differed in no
respect from his companions. He believed in the devil, whom he regarded
as a kind of evil genius, and he imagined, like all the world, that
nervous maladies were produced by demons who possessed the patient and
agitated him&rdquo; (Life of Jesus, p. 59). Dr. Geikie says: &ldquo;The
New Testament <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>leaves us in no doubt of the belief, on the part
of Jesus and the Evangelists, in the reality of these demoniacal
possessions&rdquo; (Life of Christ, vol. ii, p. 573).</p>
<p>Demonology was born of ignorance and superstition. In this debasing
superstition Jesus believed. It was a part of his religion, and has
remained a part of Christianity; for while the more intelligent of his
professed disciples have outgrown this superstition they have to the
same extent outgrown Christianity. The more ignorant, the more
depraved, and, at the same time, the more devout of his followers,
still accept it.</p>
<p>Regarding this superstition, the author of &ldquo;Supernatural
Religion&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The diseases referred to by the gospels,
and by the Jews of that time, to the action of devils, exist now, but
they are known to proceed from purely physical causes. The same
superstition and medical ignorance would enunciate the same diagnosis
at the present day. The superstition and ignorance, however, have
passed away, and, with them, the demoniacal theory. In that day the
theory was as baseless as in this. It is obvious that, with the
necessary abandonment of the theory of &lsquo;possession&rsquo; and
demoniacal origin of disease, the largest class of miracles recorded in
the gospels is at once exploded. The asserted cause of the diseases of
this class, said to have been miraculously healed, must be recognized
to be a mere vulgar superstition&rdquo; (p. 159). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span></p>
<p>Prof. Huxley, in one of his essays, discussing the Gadarene miracle,
says: &ldquo;When such a story as that about the Gadarene swine is
placed before us, the importance of the decision, whether it be
accepted or rejected, cannot be overestimated. If the demonological
part of it is to be accepted, the authority of Jesus is unmistakably
pledged to the demonological system current in Judea in the first
century. The belief in devils who possess men and can be transferred
from men to pigs becomes as much a part of Christian dogma as any
article of the creeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be pertinent to inquire what these inoffensive animals had
done that they should merit such cruelty, or what their owner had done
that his property should be thus wantonly destroyed.</p>
<p>In his narrative of this miracle Fleetwood says: &ldquo;The
spectators beheld, at a distance, the torments these poor creatures

lake, leaped from the precipices into the sea, and perished in the

"pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name="pb407">407</a>]</span>the

Christian writer the torture and destruction of these domestic animals
is no more than the burning of a field of stubble. In this miracle he
sees only a manifestation of love and kindness on the part of his
Savior. Referring to the request of the inhabitants that he depart from
their country, he says: &ldquo;The stupid request of the Gadarenes was
complied with by the blessed Jesus, who, entering the ship, returned to
the country from whence he came, leaving them a valuable pledge of his
love, and us a noble pattern of perseverance in well-doing, even when
our kindnesses are condemned or requited with injuries&rdquo; (Ibid, p.

the Steward?</p>
<p>He commends as wise and prudent the action of the steward, who, to
provide for his future welfare, causes his master&rsquo;s creditors to
defraud him. &ldquo;There was a certain rich man, which had a steward;
and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. And he
called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give
an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.
Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord
taketh away from me the stewardship: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

I am ashamed. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. So he called every
one of his lord&rsquo;s debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How
much owest thou unto my lord? And he said, An hundred measures of oil.
And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write
fifty. Then said he unto another, And how much owest thou? And he said,
An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill and
write fourscore. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he
had done wisely; for the children of this world are in their generation
wiser than the children of light. And I say unto you, Make to
yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye
fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations&rdquo;

vengeance in answer to incessant prayer, as a father who loves and
honors the favorite prodigal and neglects the faithful and obedient
worker, as an employer who pays no more for a life-time than for the
nominal service of a death-bed repentance, as an unreasonable master
who reaps where he has not sown and punishes men because he made them
defective and gave them no instructions, as a harsh despot who delivers
disobedient servants to tormentors and massacres those who object to
his rule, as a judge who is merciful to harlots and relentless towards
unbelievers, as a petulant king who drives beggars and outcasts into
the heaven which is ignored by the wise and worthy, as a ruler of the
universe who freely permits his enemy the devil to sow evil and then
punishes his victims, as a God who plunges men in the flames of hell

Abraham&rsquo;s bosom behold the sight and are not permitted to bestow

<p>These are not &ldquo;the words of the Lord Jesus,&rdquo; but of the
Pagan Epicurus, a man whose character Christians have for centuries
defamed.</p>
<p>Concerning the teachings of Jesus, Col. Thomas W. Higginson says:
&ldquo;When they tell me that Jesus taught a gospel of love, I say I
believe it. Plato taught a gospel of love before him, and you deny it.
If they say, Jesus taught <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href=
"#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>that it is better to bear an
injury than to retaliate, I say, yes, but so did Aristotle before Jesus
was born. I will accept it as the statement of Jesus if you will admit
that Aristotle said it too. I am willing that any man should come
before us and say, Jesus taught that you must love your enemies, it is
written in the Bible; but, if he will open the old manuscript of
Diogenes Laertus, he may there read in texts that have never been
disputed, that the Greek philosophers, half a dozen of them, said the
same before Jesus was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buckle says: &ldquo;That the system of morals propounded in the New
Testament contained no maxim which had not been previously enunciated,
and that some of the most beautiful passages in the apostolic writings
are quotations from Pagan authors, is well known to every scholar....
To assert that Christianity communicated to man moral truths previously
unknown, argues on the part of the asserter either gross ignorance or
wilful fraud&rdquo; (History of Civilization, vol. i, p. 129).</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill says: &ldquo;It can do truth no service to blind
the fact, known to all who have the most ordinary acquaintance with
literary history, that a large portion of the noblest and most valuable
moral teaching has been the work not only of men who did not know, but
of men who knew and rejected the Christian faith&rdquo; (Liberty).

&ldquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commenting on this dying exclamation of Christ, Dr. Conway says:
&ldquo;That cry could never be wrung from the lips of a man who saw in
his own death a prearranged plan for the world&rsquo;s salvation, and
his own return to divine glory temporarily renounced for transient
misery on earth. The fictitious theology of a thousand years shrivels

<p>Referring to this woman, Dr. Farrar says: &ldquo;This exorcism is
not elsewhere alluded to, and it would be perfectly in accordance with
the genius of Hebrew phraseology if the expression had been applied to
her in consequence of a passionate nature and an abandoned life. The
Talmudists have much to say respecting her&mdash;her wealth, her
extreme beauty, her braided locks, her shameless profligacy, her
husband Pappus, and her paramour, Pandera&rdquo; (Life of Christ, p.
162).</p>
<p>In a chapter on &ldquo;Sanctified Prostitution,&rdquo; Dr. Soury
writes: &ldquo;The Jewess is full of naive immodesty, her lip red with
desire, her eye moist and singularly luminous in the shade. Yearning
with voluptuousness, superb in her triumphs, or merely feline and
caressing, she is ever the &lsquo;insatiable,&rsquo; the woman
&lsquo;with seven devils&rsquo; of whom the scripture speaks, a kind of
burning furnace in which the blond Teuton melts like wax. So far as in
her lay, the Syrian woman, with her supple and nervous arms, drew into
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=

Rome. But who can describe the grace and the soft languor of these
daughters of Syria, their large black eyes, the warm bistre tints of
their skin? All the poets of the decadence, Catullus, Tibullus,
Propercius, have sung this wondrous being. With soft and humble voice,
languid and as though crushed by some hidden ill, dragging her limbs
over the tiles of a gynaecium, she might have been regarded as a stupid
slave. Often, her gaze lost in long reveries, she seemed dead, save
that her bosom began to swell, her eye lighted up, her breath
quickened, her cheeks became covered with crimson. The reverie becoming
a reality by a matchless power of invovation and desire, such is the
sacred disease which, thanks to Mary Magdalene, gave birth to
Christianity&rdquo; (Religion of Israel, pp. 70, 71).</p>

Christ&rsquo;s thorough perception of this unfitness, but we find
immediately after it is said to have been conferred upon him, his Lord
addresses him indignantly by the epithet of Satan, and rebukes him for
his presumption and unspirituality; and shortly afterwards this very
man thrice denied his master. Can any one maintain it to be conceivable
that Jesus should have conferred the awful power of deciding the
salvation or damnation of his fellow-men upon one so frail, so faulty,

<p class="first">What became of the Twelve Apostles?</p>
<p>The New Testament, a portion of which is admitted to have been
written as late as the latter part of the first century and nearly all
of which was really written in the second century, is silent regarding
them. Christian martyrology records their fates as follows:</p>
<p>St. Peter was crucified, at his own request head downward, and
buried in the Vatican at Rome.</p>
<p>St. Andrew, after having been scourged seven times upon his naked
body, was crucified by the proconsul of Achaia. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span></p>
<p>St. James was beheaded by Herod Antipas in Palestine.</p>
<p>St. John was &ldquo;thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil&rdquo; by
Domitian, but God &ldquo;delivered him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Philip was scourged and crucified or hanged by the magistrates
of Hierapolis.</p>
<p>St. Bartholomew was put to death by a Roman governor in Armenia.</p>
<p>St. Matthew suffered martyrdom at Naddabar in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>St. Thomas was shot to death with arrows by the Brahmans in
India.</p>
<p>St. James the Less was thrown from the pinnacle of the temple at
Jerusalem and dispatched with a club where he fell.</p>
<p>St. Simon was &ldquo;crucified and buried&rdquo; in Britain.</p>
<p>St. Jude was &ldquo;cruelly put to death&rdquo; by the Magi of
Persia.</p>
<p>St. Matthias, the successor of Judas Iscariot, if Christian
tradition is to be credited, was put to death three times, crucified,
stoned, and beheaded.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more incredible than these so-called traditions
regarding the martyrdom of the Twelve Apostles, the most of them
occurring in an empire where all religious sects enjoyed as perfect
religious freedom as the different sects do in America today. Whatever
opinion may be entertained respecting the existence of Jesus, the
Twelve Apostles belong to the realm of mythology, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>and
their alleged martyrdoms are pure inventions. Had these men really
existed Christian history at least would contain some reliable notice
of them, yet all the stories relating to them, like the story of Peter
at Rome, and John at Ephesus, are self-evident fictions. In the
significant words of the eminent Dutch theologians, Dr. Kuenen, Dr.
Oort and Dr. Hooykaas, &ldquo;All the Apostles disappear without a
trace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was Paul the Christian.</p>
<p>The leopard changed his name but did not change his spots.</p>
<p>The alleged cause of Paul&rsquo;s sudden conversion and the
transference of his hatred from Christianity to Judaism may well be
questioned. The story of the apparition will not account for it. A
genuine change of belief is not usually effected suddenly. Men
sometimes change their religion for gain or revenge. It has been
charged that Paul twice changed his, the first time for the hope of
gain, the second from a desire for revenge. The Ebionites, one of the
earliest of the Christian sects, claimed that Paul was originally a
Gentile, that becoming infatuated with the daughter of the high priest
he became a convert to Judaism for the purpose of winning her for a
wife, but being rejected, he renounced the Jewish faith and became a
vehement opponent of the law, the Sabbath, and circumcision (Epiphanius

<p>Christian writers prate about brotherly love, and yet from the very

himself quarreled with his apostles. Paul opposed the teachings of
James (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jam%202:20">ii, 20</a>).
Paul proclaimed himself the divinely appointed apostle to the Gentiles:
&ldquo;The gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%202:7">Galatians
ii, 7</a>). Peter contended that the mission had been assigned to him:
&ldquo;And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said
unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made
choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of
the gospel&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015:7">Acts xv,

<p>Paul declared Peter to be a dissembler. &ldquo;But when Peter was
come to Antioch, I withstood him face to face, because he was to be
blamed. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with
Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,
fearing them which were of the circumcision. And the other Jews
dissembled likewise with him&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>Commenting on this expression of thanks, Celsus, who lived at the
time the Four Gospels made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href=
"#pb431" name="pb431">431</a>]</span>their appearance, says:
&ldquo;This is one of their [the Christians&rsquo;] rules: Let no man
that is learned, wise, or prudent come among us; but if they be
unlearned, or a child, or an idiot, let him freely come. So they openly
declare that none but the ignorant, and those devoid of understanding,
slaves, women, and children, are fit disciples for the God they
worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the Christian teachers of that age Celsus writes as
follows: &ldquo;<a id="xd21e13069" name="xd21e13069"></a>You may see
weavers, tailors, fullers, and the most illiterate of rustic fellows,
who dare not speak a word before wise men, when they can get a company
of children and silly women together, set up to teach strange paradoxes
among them.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Christ a Myth.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The conceptions regarding the nature and character of
Christ, and the value of the Christian Scriptures as historical
evidence, are many, chief of which are the following:</p>
<p>1. Orthodox Christians believe that Christ is a historical
character, supernatural and divine; and that the New Testament
narratives, which purport to give a record of his life and teachings,
contain nothing but infallible truth.</p>
<p>2. Conservative Rationalists, like Renan, and the Unitarians,
believe that Jesus of Nazareth is a historical character and that these
narratives, eliminating the supernatural elements, which they regard as
myths, give a fairly authentic account of his life.</p>
<p>3. Many radical Freethinkers believe that Christ is a myth, of which
Jesus of Nazareth is the basis, but that these narratives are so
legendary and contradictory as to be almost<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e13118" title="Not in source">,</span> if not wholly, unworthy of
credit.</p>
<p>4. Other Freethinkers believe that Jesus Christ is a pure
myth&mdash;that he never had an existence, except as a Messianic idea,
or an imaginary solar deity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href=
"#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first of these conceptions must be rejected because the
existence of such a being is impossible, and because the Bible
narratives which support it are incredible. The second cannot be
accepted because, outside of these incredible narratives, there is no
evidence to confirm it. One of the two last is the only true and
rational conception of the Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is a myth. But what do we understand by the term myth?
Falsehood, fable, and myth, are usually considered synonymous terms.
But a falsehood, a fable, and a myth, while they may all be fictions
and equally untrue, are not the same. A falsehood is the expression of
an untruth intended to deceive. A fable is an avowed or implied fiction
usually intended to instruct or entertain. A myth is a falsehood, a
fable, or an erroneous opinion, which eventually becomes an established
belief. While a falsehood and a fable are intentional and immediate
expressions of fiction, a myth is, in most cases, an unconscious and
gradual development of one.</p>
<p>Myths are of three kinds: Historical, Philosophical, and
Poetical.</p>
<p>A Historical myth according to Strauss, and to some extent I follow
his language, is a real event colored by the light of antiquity, which
confounded the human and divine, the natural and the supernatural. The
event may be but slightly colored and the narrative essentially true,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>or it may be distorted and numberless legends
attached until but a small residuum of truth remains and the narrative
is essentially false. A large portion of ancient history, including the
Biblical narratives, are historical myths. The earliest records of all
nations and of all religions are more or less mythical. &ldquo;Nothing
great has been established,&rdquo; says Renan, &ldquo;which does not
rest on a legend. The only culprit in such cases is the humanity which
is willing to be deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Philosophical myth is an idea clothed in the dress of historical
narrative. When a mere idea is personified and presented in the form of
a man or a god it is called a pure myth. Many of the gods and heroes of
antiquity are pure myths. John Fiske refers to a myth as &ldquo;a piece
of unscientific philosophizing,&rdquo; and this is a fairly good
definition of the philosophical myth.</p>
<p>A Poetical myth is a blending of the historical and philosophical,
embellished by the creations of the imagination. The poems of Homer and
Hesiod, which were the religious text books of the ancient Greeks, and
the poetical writings of the Bible, which helped to form and foster the
Semitic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism, belong to
this class.</p>
<p>It is often difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish a
historical from a philosophical myth. Hence the non-agreement of
Freethinkers in regard to the nature of the Christ myth. Is Christ a
historical or a philosophical myth? Does an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>analysis of his alleged history disclose the
deification of a man, or merely the personification of an idea?</p>
<p>The following hypothesis, written by Mrs. Besant, of England, is, to
a considerable extent, an epitome of the views of Strauss, who, in his
masterly &ldquo;<span lang="de">Leben Jesu</span>,&rdquo; adopts the
historical myth:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The mythic theory accepts an
historical groundwork for many of the stories about Jesus, but it does
not seek to explain the miraculous by attenuating it into the
natural.... It attributes the incredible portions of the history to the
Messianic theories current among the Jews. The Messiah would do this
and that; Jesus was the Messiah; therefore, Jesus did this and
that&mdash;such, argue the supporters of the mythical theory, was the
method in which the mythus was developed.... Thus, Jesus is descended
from David, because the Messiah was to come of David&rsquo;s lineage;
his birth is announced by an angelic visitant, because the birth of the
Messiah must not be less honored than that of Isaac or of Samson; he is
born of a virgin, because God says of the Messiah, &lsquo;this day have
I begotten thee,&rsquo; implying the direct paternity of God, and
because the prophecy in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%20110:1">Ps. cx,
1</a>). Thus the form of the Messiah was cast, and all that had to be
done was to pour in the human metal; those who alleged that the Messiah
had come in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, adapted his story to the
story of the Messiah, pouring the history of Jesus into the mould
already made for the Messiah, and thus the mythus was transformed into
a history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing theory, with various modifications, is accepted by a
majority of Freethinkers at the present time.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that Christ is a philosophical myth, based, like the
preceding one, upon the Messianic idea, is thus presented by T. B.
Wakeman:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Never was there an example of a
word becoming a believed person, under this law of materialization,
more plainly and evolutionally than the &lsquo;Messiah&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Son of Man&rsquo; of the Hebrew prophecies.... The Christ,
&lsquo;Jesus,&rsquo; was no man, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439"
href="#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span>for the reason that he was
prophesied and visionated into this world and life to do a work that it
would be utterly absurd to suppose a man could ever do. The Romans had
killed, and could easily kill, every man who had tried to resist their
oppression. Now the God Yahweh by his &lsquo;eternally begotten
son,&rsquo; spiritized as the &lsquo;Son of Man,&rsquo; that is the
&lsquo;Soul of the State,&rsquo; as Shakespeare makes Ulysses say it,
must, in order to be of any avail appear with supernatural powers. He
was the personified people, Israel; he had been crucified alive, in
their subjection and massacre even to the death and Hades. But by
supernatural power he, the Israel, would rise again and bring the final
judgment backed by the infinite power of the nation&rsquo;s Father,
Yahweh. It was only a Spirit-God who could do this&mdash;nothing less
could be originated, or thought of, or provided, for such a superhuman
purpose. A person, a man, a reformer, a weak edition of Socrates, or
Savonarola or Bruno! How absurd! The human heart in its despair by its
imagination, brought a God into the world to do a God&rsquo;s work.
&lsquo;No man,&rsquo; said Napoleon; &lsquo;nor a God,&rsquo; says
Science, except the idea. Such it was that finally united the millions
of Asia, Africa, Europe, and America, in a dream so intoxicating that
it dares not to be awakened though the dawn of Science is
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wakeman argues that the silence of history <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span>for
one hundred years after the alleged appearance of Christ can be
explained only upon this hypothesis of an ideal Christ. To this the
advocate of the historical mythus may, I think, very properly reply:
History, for the most part, takes cognizance only of noted men and
important events; and while this silence precludes the existence of the
supernatural Christ of Christians, and even that of the human Jesus of
Renan, it does not necessarily preclude the existence of an obscure
religious teacher and an insignificant sect which subsequently, by a
chain of fortuitous circumstances, became the mightiest among the
religions of the world.</p>
<p>Again, this hypothesis presupposes a considerable degree of
intellectuality on the part of those who evolved this ideal Christ,
while tradition represents the founders of the Christian religion as
grossly ignorant. Had this Christ originally sprung from the
Hellenistic Jews of intellectual Alexandria instead of from the Jewish
dregs of illiterate Galilee, Mr. Wakeman&rsquo;s theory would appeal
with surprising force. Still it must be admitted that some of the
earliest Christian sects denied the material existence of Christ.</p>
<p>Another philosophical hypothesis, the astronomical, which regards
Christ as a solar myth, is advanced by Volney.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;These mythological traditions
recounted that, &lsquo;in the beginning, a woman and a man had, by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name=
"pb441">441</a>]</span>their fall, introduced into the world sin and
misery.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;By this was denoted the
astronomical fact that the celestial virgin and the herdsman (Bootes),
by setting heliacally at the autumnal equinox, delivered the world to
the wintry constellations, and seemed, on falling below the horizon, to
introduce into the world the genius of evil (Ahrimanes), represented by
the constellation of the serpent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;These traditions related that the
woman had decoyed and seduced the man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And, in fact, the virgin setting
first seems to draw the herdsman after her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That the woman tempted him by
offering him fruit fair to the sight, and good to eat, which gave the
knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And, in fact, the virgin holds in
her hand a branch of fruit which she seems to offer to the herdsman;
and the branch, emblem of autumn, placed in the picture of Mithra
between winter and summer seems to open the door and give knowledge,
the key to good and evil.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That this couple had been driven
from the celestial garden, and that a cherub with a flaming sword had
been placed at the gate to guard it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And, in fact, when the virgin and
the herdsman fall beneath the western horizon, Perseus rises on the
other side; and this genius, with a sword in his hand, seems to drive
them from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span>summer heaven, the garden and dominion of fruits
and flowers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That of the virgin should be born,
spring up, an offspring, a child, who should bruise the head of the
serpent, and deliver the world from sin.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This denotes the sun, which, at
the moment of the winter solstice, precisely when the Persian magi drew
the horoscope of the new year, was placed on the bosom of the virgin,
rising heliacally in the eastern horizon. On this account he was
figured in their astrological pictures under the form of a child
suckled by a chaste virgin, and became afterward, at the vernal
equinox, the ram, or lamb, triumphant over the constellation of the
serpent, which disappeared from the skies.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That, in his infancy, the restorer
of divine and celestial nature would live abased, humble, obscure and
indigent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And this, because the winter sun
is abased below the horizon and that this first period of his four ages
or seasons is a time of obscurity, scarcity, fasting and want.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That being put to death by the
wicked, he had risen gloriously; that he had reascended from hell to
heaven, where he would reign forever.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This is a sketch of the life of
the sun, who, finishing his career at the winter solstice, when Typhon
and the rebel angels gain the dominion, seems to be put to death by
them; but who soon after is born again, and rises into the vault of
heaven, where he reigns.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443"
href="#pb443" name="pb443">443</a>]</span></p>
<p>Count Volney&rsquo;s portraiture of the second member of the
Christian godhead is, for the most part, accurate. Numerous other
analogies between him and the ancient sun gods might be named.</p>
<p>It is the belief of many, however, that these solar attributes of
Christ are later accretions borrowed by the Roman Catholic church from
the Pagan religions which it supplanted.</p>
<p>While all Freethinkers are agreed that the Christ of the New
Testament is a myth they are not, as we have seen, and perhaps never
will be, fully agreed as to the nature of this myth. Some believe that
he is a historical myth; others that he is a pure myth. Some believe
that Jesus, a real person, was the germ of this Christ whom subsequent
generations gradually evolved; others contend that the man Jesus, as
well as the Christ, is wholly a creation of the human imagination.
After carefully weighing the evidence and arguments in support of each
hypothesis the writer, while refraining from expressing a dogmatic
affirmation regarding either, is compelled to accept the former as the
more probable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=

<h2 class="main">Sources of the Christ Myth&mdash;Ancient
Religions.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Christ and the religion he is said to have founded are
composite products, made up, to a great extent, of the attributes, the
doctrines, and the customs of the gods and the religions which preceded
them and existed around them. The Christian believes that Christ is
coexistent with his father, Jehovah&mdash;that he has existed from the
foundations of the world. This is in a measure true. The years that
have elapsed since his alleged incarnation are few compared with the
years of his gestation in the intellectual womb of humanity.</p>
<p>To understand the origin and nature of Christ and Christianity it is
necessary to know something of the religious systems and doctrines from
which they were evolved. The following, some in a large and others in
but a small degree, contributed to mold this supposed divine
incarnation and inspire this supposed revelation: 1. Nature or Sex
Worship. 2. Solar Worship. 3. Astral Worship. 4. Worship of the
Elements and Forces of Nature. 5. Worship of Animals and Plants. 6.
Fetichism. 7. Polytheism. 8. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href=

Idea. 10. The Messianic Idea. 11. The Logos. 12. The Perfect Man.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">1. Nature or Sex Worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The deification and worship of the procreative organs
and the generative principles of life is one of the oldest and one of
the most universal of religions. It has been called the foundation of
all religions. In some nations the worship of the male energy, Phallic
worship, predominated; in others the worship of the female energy, Yoni
worship, prevailed. But in all both elements were recognized. Mrs.
Besant says: &ldquo;Womanhood has been worshiped in all ages of the
world, and maternity has been deified by all creeds: from the savage
who bowed before the female symbol of motherhood, to the philosophic
Comtist who adores woman &lsquo;in the past, the present, and the
future,&rsquo; as mother, wife, and daughter, the worship of the female
element in nature has run side by side with that of the male; the
worship is one and the same in all religions, and runs in an unbroken
thread from the barbarous ages to the present time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the life generating gods may be named Vishnu, Osiris, Zeus,
Priapus, Adonis, Bacchus, Saturn, Apollo, Baal, Moloch, and Jehovah.
Among the receptive life producing goddesses were Isis, Rhea, Ceres,
Venus, Istar, Astarte, Aschera, Devaki, Eve, and Mary. Where the
worship of the female element largely prevailed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span>the
Virgin and Child was a favorite deity. Isis and Horus, Rhea and
Quirinus, Leto and Apollo, Devaki and Krishna, Mary and Christ, all had
their inception in the sex worship of primitive man.</p>
<p>The symbol of Phallic worship, the cross, has become the emblem of
Christianity. I quote again from our English authoress: &ldquo;We find
the cross in India, Egypt, Thibet, Japan, always as the sign of
life-giving power; it was worn as an amulet by girls and women, and
seems to have been specially worn by the women attached to the temples
[sacred prostitutes], as a symbol of what was, to them, a religious
calling. The cross is, in fact, nothing but the refined phallus, and in
the Christian religion is a significant emblem of its Pagan origin; it
was adored, carved in temples, and worn as a sacred emblem by sun and
nature worshipers, long before there were any Christians to adore,
carve, and wear it. The crowd kneeling before the cross in Roman
Catholic and in High Anglican churches is a simple reproduction of the
crowd who knelt before it in the temples of ancient days, and the girls
who wear it amongst ourselves are&mdash;in the most innocent
unconsciousness of its real significance&mdash;exactly copying the
Indian and Egyptian women of an elder time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;American Cyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The crux ansata,
so common on Egyptian monuments, symbolizes the union of the active and
passive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span>principles of nature. In the Etruscan tombs have
been found crosses of four phalli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding this subject, McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical
Literature,&rdquo; a standard orthodox Christian authority, says:
&ldquo;The sign of the cross is found as a holy symbol among several
ancient nations.... Sometimes it is the phallus&rdquo; (Art. Cross).
The same authority says that the Tau or sign of life (one form of the
Phallic cross) &ldquo;was adopted by some of the early Christians in
lieu of the cross.... Christian inscriptions at the great oasis are
headed by this symbol; it has been found on Christian monuments at
Rome&rdquo; (Art. Egypt).</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Inman, of England, one of the foremost authorities on
ancient symbolism, says: &ldquo;It has been reserved for Christian art
to crowd our churches with the emblems of Bel and Astarte, Baalim and
Ashtoreth, linga and yoni, and to elevate the phallus to the position
of the supreme deity&rdquo; (Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian
Symbolism, p. 16).</p>
<p>Describing the chasuble, worn by Christian priests, Dr. Inman says:
&ldquo;Its form is that of the vesica piscis, one of the most common
emblems of the yoni. It is adorned by the Triad. When worn by the
priest, he forms the male element, and with the chasuble completes the
sacred four. When worshiping the ancient goddesses, whom Mary has
displaced, the officiating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href=
"#pb448" name="pb448">448</a>]</span>ministers clothed themselves in
feminine attire. Hence the use of the chemise, etc. Even the tonsured
head, adopted from the priests of the Egyptian Isis, represents
&lsquo;l&rsquo;anneau&rsquo;; so that on head, shoulders, breast and
body, we may see on Christian priests the relics of the worship of
Venus, and the adoration of woman! How horrible all this would sound
if, instead of using veiled language, we had employed vulgar words. The
idea of a man adorning himself, when ministering before God and the
people, with the effigies of those parts which nature as well as
civilization teaches us to conceal, would be simply disgusting, but
when all is said to be mysterious and connected with hidden
signification, almost everybody tolerates and many eulogize or admire
it!&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 104).</p>
<p>Westropp and Wake, in their &ldquo;Ancient Symbol Worship,&rdquo;
state that Judaism and Christianity have been largely derived from
Phallic worship. Westropp says: &ldquo;Circumcision was in its
inception a purely Phallic ordinance.&rdquo; Our Christian marriage
ceremonies, he says, are relics of this worship. Wake says: &ldquo;In
the recognition of God as the universal father, the great Parent of
mankind, there is a development of the fundamental idea of Phallism. In
the position assigned to Mary as the mother of God the paramount
principle of the primitive belief is again predominant. The nimbus, the
aureole, the cross, the fish, and even the spires of churches,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href="#pb449" name=
"pb449">449</a>]</span>are symbols retained from the old Phallic
worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander Wilder says: &ldquo;There is not a fast or festival,
procession or sacrament, social custom or religious symbol, existing at
the present day which has not been taken bodily from Phallism, or from
some successive system of Paganism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aschera, the voluptuous goddess of fertility, was a Hebrew goddess
and was worshiped, along with Jehovah, in the temple itself at
Jerusalem. Jules Soury, of France, in his &ldquo;Religion of
Israel&rdquo; (p. 68), says: &ldquo;Under the kings of Judah and
Israel, the symbol of Aschera [the phallus] became an object of general
piety which was found in every house. Thus in the provinces of France,
we still find gigantic crosses on the high roads, on the crossways of
the woods which serve as resting places at the Fete Dieu, while, under
the porches of churches, vendors of religious toys still sell little
Christs in wood or metal for a few half-pence. The rich women of
Israel, the bourgeoises of Jerusalem, wore the symbols of Aschera in
gold and silver, a sort of medals of the Virgin of the time, which were
at once jewels and objects of devotion.&rdquo; Dulaure, another French
author, tells us that the worship of Priapus, the god of procreation,
under the name of St. Fontin, with rites of the most indelicate
character, prevailed in the Catholic church in several provinces of
France and Italy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450"
name="pb450">450</a>]</span>up to the middle of the eighteenth century,
or later.</p>
<p>The sex worship of the Semitic tribes of Western Asia had its
origin, it is believed, in India, where, under the name of Sakti
worship, it prevails today, three-fourth of the Hindoos, it is claimed,
belonging to this sect. The worship is thus described by the
&ldquo;Encyclopedia Britannica&rsquo;s&rdquo; chief authority on the
subject, Prof. H. H. Wilson: &ldquo;The ceremonies are mostly gone
through in a mixed society, the Sakti being personified by a naked
female, to whom meat and wine are offered and then distributed amongst
the company. These eat and drink alternately with gesticulations and
mantras&mdash;and when the religious part of the business is over, the
males and females rush together and indulge in a wild orgy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing is almost an exact description of the Agapae, or Love
Feasts, as they were observed for a time in the early Christian
church.</p>
<p>Associated with the worship of Aschera and other goddesses of this
character was what is known as sacred prostitution. Thousands of women,
the fairest and best bred of their race, and also men (sodomites),
prostituted themselves for the support of their religion. John Clark
Ridpath, in his &ldquo;History of the World,&rdquo; dwells upon this
institution. It was practiced for centuries among the Hebrews,
constituting a part of the temple worship, the Jewish kings,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=
"pb451">451</a>]</span>with the exception of a few, like Hezekiah and
Josiah, sanctioning it. Solomon&rsquo;s temple was largely a Pagan
temple. Before it stood two Phallic pillars, while its doors were
ornamented with symbols of Phallic and Solar worship. Solomon
worshiped, in addition to other Pagan deities, Astarte (Ashtoreth), the
Sidonian Aschera (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kg%2011:5-7">1
Kings</a><a id="xd21e13324" name="xd21e13324"></a> xi, 5, 7). The
pietistic writers of the Bible condemn it, but in spite of a few
spasmodic efforts to suppress the worship, it continued to flourish
until long after the Captivity. From Soury&rsquo;s account of the
sanctified prostitution of Israel I quote the following: &ldquo;The
tents of the sacred prostitutes were generally erected on the
&lsquo;high places,&rsquo; where sacrifices were offered, beside the
tablet of Baal or Iahveh [Jehovah] and the symbol of Aschera (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2057:7">Isaiah lvii,
7</a>, et seq.; <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hos%204:17">Hosea iv,
17</a>). These tents were woven and ornamented with figures by the
priestesses of Aschera. Robed in splendid garments, their tresses
dripping with perfumes, their cheeks painted with vermilion, their eyes
black-circled with antimony, their eyelashes lengthened with a compound
of gums, musk and ebony, the priestesses awaited the worshipers of the
goddess within these tents (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

8</a>); they fixed their own price and conditions, and poured the money
into the treasury of the temple&rdquo; (Religion of Israel, p. 71).
After describing the temple of Zarpanit, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name="pb452">452</a>]</span>was
furnished with cells for the use of the Babylonian women, Dr. Soury
says: &ldquo;Cells of the same kind, serving the same purpose, existed
at Jerusalem in the very temple of Jehovah, wherein Aschera had her
symbol and was adored&rdquo; (Ibid 72). &ldquo;Prostitutes,&rdquo; says
this writer, &ldquo;were of both sexes. The men were called kedeschim,
the women kedeschoth&mdash;that is &lsquo;holy, vowed,
consecrated.&rsquo; Deuteronomy bears witness that both the one and the
other brought the hire of their prostitution into the treasury of the
temple of Jehovah. This paid in part the expenses of worship at
Jerusalem&rdquo; (Ib. 73).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If then, in Hebrew law and
practice,&rdquo; says Dr. Inman, &ldquo;we find such a strong infusion
of the sexual element, we cannot be surprised if it should be found
elsewhere, and gradually influence Christianity&rdquo; (Ancient
Symbolism). &ldquo;The worship of God the Father has repeatedly clashed
with that of God the Mother, and the votaries of each respectively have
worn badges characteristic of the sex of their deity.... Our sexual
sections are as well marked as those in ancient Jerusalem, which swore
by Jehovah and Ashtoreth respectively&rdquo; (Ibid).</p>
<p>It is well known that religious prostitution has been practiced in
some form by Christ&rsquo;s devotees from the earliest ages of the
church down to the present time. Writing of the middle ages, Lecky, the
historian of European morals, says: &ldquo;We may not lay much stress
on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>such isolated instances of depravity as that of
Pope <a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2023">John
XXIII</a>., who was condemned, among many other crimes, for incest and
adultery; or the abbot-elect of St. Augustine, at Canterbury, who in
1171 was found, on investigation, to have seventeen illegitimate
children in a single village; or an abbot of St. Pelayo, in Spain, who
in 1130 was proved to have kept no less than seventy concubines; or
Henry III., Bishop of Liege, who was deposed in 1274 for having
sixty-five illegitimate children; but it is impossible to resist the
evidence of a long chain of Councils and ecclesiastical writers, who
conspire in depicting far greater evils than simple concubinage.... The
writers of the middle ages are full of accounts of nunneries that were
like brothels, of the vast multitude of infanticides within their
walls, and of that inveterate prevalence of incest among the clergy,
which rendered it necessary again and again to issue the most stringent
enactments that priests should not be permitted to live with their
mothers or sisters&rdquo; (History of European Morals, Vol. II, P.
331).</p>
<p>For centuries the worship of the Virgin Mary, the Christian goddess
of reproduction and motherhood, was supreme; the worship of God and
Christ being subordinated to it. During these centuries, Hallam tells
us, chastity was almost unknown. In every land, every class ignored the
seventh commandment, because it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454"
href="#pb454" name="pb454">454</a>]</span>was taught and believed that
all offenses of this character were condoned by the Virgin. Hallam
cites numerous instances of her alleged interventions in behalf of
those who indulged in illegitimate practices. The following is one:
&ldquo;In one tale the Virgin takes the shape of a nun, who had eloped
from the convent, and performs her duties ten years, till, tired of a
libertine life, she returns unsuspected. This was in consideration of
her having never omitted to say an Ave as she passed the Virgin&rsquo;s
image&rdquo; (Middle Ages, p. 604).</p>
<p>Christian chivalry, so much lauded in our day, was simply a form of
sex worship. Hallam characterizes it as unbridled libertinism. The
writings of that age, like those of Boccaccio, he says, indicate
&ldquo;a general dissoluteness in the intercourse of the sexes.... The
violation of marriage vows passes in them for an incontestable
privilege of the brave and the fair&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 666).</p>
<p>Holy pilgrimages to the shrines of saints were usually pilgrimages
to the shrine of Venus. &ldquo;Some of the modes of atonement which the
church most approved, were particularly hostile to public morals. None
was so usual as pilgrimage; whether to Jerusalem or Rome, which were
the great objects of devotion, or to the shrine of some national saint,
a James of Compostella, a David, or a Thomas Becket. This licensed
vagrancy was naturally productive of dissoluteness, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name=
"pb455">455</a>]</span>especially among the women. Our English ladies,
in their zeal to obtain the spiritual treasures of Rome, are said to
have relaxed the necessary caution about one that was in their own
custody&rdquo; (Ib., p. 607).</p>
<p>The prelates of the church, being equally culpable, winked at the
licentiousness of the lower orders of the clergy. &ldquo;In every
country,&rdquo; says Hallam, &ldquo;the secular and parochial clergy
kept women in their houses, upon more or less acknowledged terms of
intercourse, by a connivance of their ecclesiastical superiors&rdquo;
(Ib., p. 353). &ldquo;A writer of respectable authority asserts that
the clergy frequently obtained a bishop&rsquo;s license to cohabit with
a mate&rdquo; (Ib., p. 354).</p>
<p>Another form of &ldquo;sanctified&rdquo; sexual indulgence, and
which received the sanction of the church, was what is known as
Marquette. Concerning this custom Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage, in her
&ldquo;Woman, Church and State,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The law known as
Marchetta, or Marquette, compelled newly-married women to a most
dishonorable servitude. They were regarded as the rightful prey of the
Feudal Lord from one to three days after their marriage, and from this
custom the eldest son of the serf was held as the son of the Lord....
Marquette was claimed by the Lord&rsquo;s Spiritual, as well as by the
Lord&rsquo;s Temporal. The Church, indeed, was the bulwark of this base
feudal claim.&rdquo; This is affirmed by the French historian,
Michelet. He says: &ldquo;The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456"
href="#pb456" name="pb456">456</a>]</span>lords spiritual (clergy) had
this right no less than the lords temporal. The parson, being a lord,
expressly claimed the first fruits of the bride&rdquo; (<span lang=
"fr">La Sorcerie</span>, p. 62).</p>
<p>The brazen lewdness of medieval Christianity has been driven into
privacy. But it still exists, and it is still religious. The Italian
patriot, Garibaldi, bears this testimony: &ldquo;In Rome, in 1849, I
myself visited every convent. I was present at all the investigations.
Without a single exception we found instruments of torture, and a
cellar with the bodies of infant children.&rdquo; Referring to the
priests connected with certain convents, Dr. Inman says: &ldquo;Their
practice was to instruct their victims that whatever was said or done
must be accompanied by a pious sentence. Thus, &lsquo;I love you
dearly&rsquo; was a profane expression; but &lsquo;I desire your
company in the name of Jesus,&rsquo; and &lsquo;I embrace in you the
Holy Virgin,&rsquo; was orthodox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Protestant readers, generally, will accept this testimony as true of
Catholic countries. But have Protestant countries a purer record?
Lecky, classed as a Protestant historian, says: &ldquo;The two
countries which are most thoroughly pervaded by Protestant theology are
probably Scotland and Sweden; and if we measure their morality by the
common though somewhat defective test that is furnished by the number
of illegitimate births, the first is well known to be considerably
below the average morality of European <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb457" href="#pb457" name="pb457">457</a>]</span>nations, while the
second, in this as in general criminality, has been pronounced by a
very able and impartial Protestant witness, who has had the fullest
means of judging, to be very far below every other Christian
nation&rdquo; (European Morals, Vol. I, p. 391).</p>
<p>The religion of Christ as it exists today is not only in its
external forms, but in its very essence, largely a survival of the
nature worship of old. That it is closely allied to it is admitted by
Christian ministers themselves. The Rev. Frederick Robertson says:
&ldquo;The devotional feelings are often singularly allied to the
animal nature. They conduct the unconscious victim of feelings that
appear divine, into a state of life at which the world stands aghast;
fanaticism is always united with either excessive lewdness or desperate
asceticism&rdquo; (Essays). The Rev. S. Baring-Gould, in &ldquo;Freaks
of Fanaticism,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The religious passion verges so
closely on the sexual passion that a slight additional pressure given
to it bursts the partition, and both are confused in a frenzy of
religious debauch.&rdquo; The Rev. J. H. Noyes says: &ldquo;Religious
love is a very near neighbor to sex love, and they always get mixed in
the intimacies and social excitement of [religious]
revivals.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Scarcely less prevalent than sex worship was the
worship of the sun. While sex worship was confined chiefly to the
generation of human life, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href=
"#pb458" name="pb458">458</a>]</span>sun worship comprehended the
generation of all life. The sun was recognized as the generative power
of the universe. He overshadows the receptive earth from whom all life
is born. I quote from M. Soury: &ldquo;Amid all these forces, the
mightiest is, without contradiction, the sun, the fire of heaven,
father of earthly fire, unique and supreme cause of motion and life on
our planet. There is no need or reason to understand that the very
life, and as it were the blood of our celestial father flows in the
veins of the Earth, our mother. In the time of love, when the luminous
heaven embraces her, from her fertilized womb springs forth a world. It
is she who quivers on the plains where the soft moist air waves gently
on the grasses; it is she who climbs in the bush, who soars in the oak,
who fills the solitude with the joyous twitter of birds beneath the
cloudlet, or from the leaf-lined nests; it is she who in seas and in
running waters, or mountains and in woods, couples the gorgeous male
with the ardent female, throbs in every bosom, loves in every life. But
all this terrestrial life, all this warmth and all this light are but
effluents from the sun.&rdquo; (Religion of Israel, pp. 3, 4.)</p>
<p>Prof. Tyndall says: &ldquo;We are no longer in a poetical but in a
purely mechanical sense, the children of the sun.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
sun,&rdquo; said Napoleon Bonaparte, &ldquo;gives all things life and
fertility. It is the true God of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Newton, M.R.C.S., of England, says: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459" name=
"pb459">459</a>]</span>&ldquo;The glorious sun, that &lsquo;god of this
world,&rsquo; the source of life and light to our earth, was early
adored, and an effigy thereof used as a symbol. Mankind watched with
rapture its rays gain strength daily in the Spring, until the golden
glories of Midsummer had arrived, when the earth was bathed during the
longest days in his beams, which ripened the fruits that his returning
course had started into life. When the sun once more began its course
downwards to the winter solstice, his votaries sorrowed, for he seemed
to sicken and grow paler at the advent of December, when his rays
scarcely reached the earth, and all nature, benumbed and cold, sunk
into a death-like sleep. Hence feasts and fasts were instituted to mark
the commencement of the various phases of the solar year, which have
continued from the earliest known period, under various names, to our
own times&rdquo; (The Assyrian Grove).</p>
<p>The most prominent deities in the pantheons of the gods were solar
deities. Among these were Osiris, Vishnu, Mithra, Apollo, Hercules,
Adonis, Bacchus, and Baal. In the worship of some of these gods sex and
solar worship were united.</p>
<p>The early Israelites were mostly sun worshipers. And even in later
times, the sun god, Baal, divided with Jehovah the worship of the Jews.
Saul, Jonathan, and David named their children in honor of this god.
&ldquo;Saul begat Jonathan, ... and Esh-baal. And the son of Jonathan
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name=
"pb460">460</a>]</span>Merib-baal&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chr%208:33-34">1
Chron. viii, 33, 34</a>). David named his last son, save one, Beeliada,
&ldquo;Baal Knows,&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chr%2014:7">1 Chron.
xiv, 7</a>). Solomon&rsquo;s worship included not merely the worship of
Jehovah, but that of Baal and other gods. His temple was filled with
Pagan ornaments and emblems pertaining to solar worship. Regarding this
the Rev. Dr. Oort of Holland says: &ldquo;Solomon&rsquo;s temple had
much in common with heathen edifices, and slight modifications might
have made it a suitable temple for Baal. This need not surprise us, for
the ancient religion of the Israelitish tribes was itself a form of
Nature-worship just as much as the religions of the Canaanites,
Phenicians, Philistines, and other surrounding peoples were. Most of
the Israelites certainly saw no harm in these ornaments, since they
were not aware of any very great difference between the character of
Yahweh [Jehovah] and that of Baal, Astarte, or Moloch&rdquo; (Bible for
Learners, vol. ii, p. 88). Long after the time of Solomon the horses
and chariots of the Sun were kept in the temple (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kgs%2023:11">2 Kings
xxiii, 11</a>). Many of the stories concerning Moses, Joshua, Jonah,
and other Bible characters are solar myths. Samson was a sun god. Dr.
Oort says: &ldquo;Sun-worship was by no means unknown to the
Israelites.... The myths that were circulated among these people show
that they were zealous worshipers of the sun. These myths are still
preserved, but, as in all other cases, they are so much altered as to
be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href="#pb461" name=
"pb461">461</a>]</span>hardly recognizable. The writer who has
preserved them for us lived at a time when the worship of the sun had
long ago died out. He transforms the sun god into an Israelite hero
[Samson]&rdquo; (Ibid i, p. 414). St. Augustine believed that Samson
and the sun god Hercules were one.</p>
<p>Charles Francois Dupuis, in his &ldquo;Origin of Worship,&rdquo; one
of the most elaborate and remarkable works on mythology ever penned,
shows that nearly all the religions of the world, including
Christianity, were derived largely from solar worship. All the solar
deities, he says, have a common history. This history, summarized, is
substantially as follows: &ldquo;The god is born about December 25th,
without sexual intercourse, for the sun, entering the winter solstice,
emerges in the sign of Virgo, the heavenly Virgin. His mother remains
ever-virgin, since the rays of the sun, passing through the zodiacal
sign, leave it intact. His infancy is begirt with dangers, because the
new-born Sun is feeble in the midst of the winter&rsquo;s fogs and
mists, which threaten to devour him; his life is one of toil and peril,
culminating at the spring equinox in a final struggle with the powers
of darkness. At that period the day and night are equal, and both fight
for the mastery. Though the night veil the Sun and he seems dead;
though he has descended out of sight, below the earth, yet he rises
again triumphant, and he rises in the sign of the Lamb, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462" name="pb462">462</a>]</span>and
is thus the Lamb of God, carrying away the darkness and death of the
winter months. Henceforth he triumphs, growing ever stronger and more
brilliant. He ascends into the zenith, and there he glows, on the right
hand of God, himself God, the very substance of the Father, the
brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, upholding
all things by his life-giving power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. G. W. Brown, author of &ldquo;Researches in Oriental
History,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Strange as it may seem, whilst Mithras and
Osiris, Dionysos and Bacchus, Apollo and Serapis, with many others
[including Christ] in name, all masculine sun gods, and all
interblended, a knowledge of one is generally a knowledge of the whole,
wherever located or worshiped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Christ was not originally a solar god he wears today the livery
of one. His mother, the Virgin, was the mother of the solar gods; his
birthday, Christmas, is the birthday of all the gods of the sun; his
Twelve Apostles correspond to the twelve signs of the Zodiac; according
to the Gospels, at his crucifixion the sun was eclipsed, he expired
toward sunset, and rose again with the sun; the day appointed for his
worship, the Lord&rsquo;s day, is the die solis, Sunday, of the sun
worshipers; while the principal feasts observed in memory of him were
once observed in honor of their gods. &ldquo;Every detail of the Sun
myth,&rdquo; says the noted astronomer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb463" href="#pb463" name="pb463">463</a>]</span>Richard A. Proctor,
&ldquo;is worked into the record of the Galilean teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cross we have seen was a symbol of Phallic worship. The cross,
and especially the crucifix, was also an emblem of solar worship. It
was carved or painted on, or within, a circle representing the horizon,
the head and feet and the outstretched arms of the sacrificial offering
or crucified Redeemer pointing toward the four quarters of the horizon.
The Lord&rsquo;s Supper, observed in memory of Christ, was observed in
memory of Mithra, Bacchus, and other solar gods. The nimbus, or
aureola, surrounding the head of Jesus in his portraits represents the
rays of the sun. It was thus that the ancient adorers of the sun
adorned the effigies of their god. There still exists a pillar erected
by the sun worshipers of Carthage. On this pillar is carved the sun
god, Baal, with a nimbus encircling his head.</p>
<p>The Christian doctrine of the resurrection had its origin in sun
worship. As the sun, the Father, rose from the dead, so it was believed
that his earthly children would also rise from the dead. &ldquo;The
daily disappearance and the subsequent rise of the sun,&rdquo; says
Newton, &ldquo;appeared to many of the ancients as a true resurrection;
thus, while the east came to be regarded as the source of light and
warmth, happiness and glory, the west was associated with darkness and
chill, decay and death. This led to the custom of burying the dead so
as to face the east when they rose again, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb464" href="#pb464" name="pb464">464</a>]</span>and of building
temples and shrines with an opening toward the east. To effect this,
Vitruvius, two thousand years ago, gave precise rules, which are still
followed by Christian architects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max Mueller, in his &ldquo;Origin of Religion,&rdquo; (pp. 200,
201), says: &ldquo;People wonder why so much of the old mythology, the
daily talk, of the Aryans was solar: what else could it have been? The
names of the sun are endless and so are his stories; but who he was,
whence he came and whither he went, remained a mystery from beginning
to end.... Man looked up to the sun, yearning for the response of a
soul, and though that response never came, though his senses recoiled,
dazzled and blinded by an effulgence which he could not support, yet he
never doubted that the invisible was there, and that, where his senses
failed him, where he could neither grasp nor comprehend, he might still
shut his eyes and trust, fall down and worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This worship of old survives in the worship of today. A knowledge of
the location, the limits and the nature of the sun has gradually
convinced the world that this is not God&rsquo;s dwelling place; but
somewhere in the infinite expanse of the blue beyond they fancy he has
his throne. To this imaginary being is rendered the same adoration that
was rendered to him by primitive man&mdash;the adoration of childish
ignorance.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Astral Worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The worship of the planets and stars was probably
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span>a later development than sex and solar worship.
It flourished for a time in nearly every part of the world, and left
its impress on the religions that succeeded it.</p>
<p>In Chaldea, one of the principal sources of Judaism and
Christianity, the worship of the stars prevailed. I quote from Dr.
Ridpath: &ldquo;In their aspirations for communion with the higher
powers, the yearning of the ancient Chaldeans turned upwards to the
planets and the stars. The horizon of the Babylonian plain was uniform
and boundless. It was the heaven above rather than the earth beneath,
which exhibited variety and life. The Zodiac was ever new with its
brilliant evolutions. Through the clear atmosphere the tracks of the
shining orbs could be traced in every phase and transposition. With
each dawn of morning light, with each recurrence of the evening
twilight, a new panorama spread before the reverent imagination of the
dreamer, and he saw in the moving spheres not only the abode but the
manifested glory of his gods&rdquo; (History of the World, vol. 1, p.
138).</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Until today, in the high light of
civilization, the idea of some kind of domination of the stars over the
affairs of human life has hardly released its hold on the minds of men;
and the language of the old Chaldean ritual of signs has still a
familiar sound in the ears of the credulous&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 140).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=
"pb466">466</a>]</span></p>
<p>After alluding to the ancient Vedic religion, which recognized in
the stars the souls of our departed ancestors, Prof. John Fiske says:
&ldquo;The Christianized German peasant, fifty centuries later, tells
his children that the stars are angels&rsquo; eyes, and the English
cottager impresses it on the youthful mind that it is wicked to point
to the stars, though why he cannot tell&rdquo; (Myths and Myth Makers,
p. 76).</p>
<p>In the Zodiac the Sun had twelve palaces. Each palace had a star for
a god, and each was subject to the Sun. Each day of the week was
governed by a planet, and each hour of the day had its controlling
star. Many scholars, including Jefferson, have held that Christ and his
Twelve Apostles relate to the Zodiac and were derived from this stellar
worship. The seven days of the week are still dedicated to the old
planetary gods, and, with a few modifications, bear their names.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;
Encyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The Jews, as well as the early
Christians, had no special names for the single days, but counted their
number from the previous Sabbath, beginning with Sunday, as the first
after the Sabbath, and ending with Friday, as the sixth after the
previous, or eve (Ereb) of the next Sabbath. After a very short time,
however, young Christianity, which in the same manner had endeavored to
count from the feria secunda, or second day after Sunday, to the
Septima (or Saturday), had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href=
"#pb467" name="pb467">467</a>]</span>to fall back again upon the old
heathen names&rdquo; (Art. Week).</p>
<p>The planetary gods Nardouk (Jupiter), Adar (Saturn), Istar (Venus),
Nergal (Mars), and Nebo (Mercury), were all worshiped by the ancient
Israelites. Istar was called &ldquo;Queen of the Stars.&rdquo; Moloch,
the rival of Jehovah, who shared for centuries the worship of the
Hebrews, had his blazing star, the emblem of his implacable cruelty.
The worship of Astarte, daughter of the moon, and &ldquo;Queen of
Heaven,&rdquo; whose emblem was a star, was introduced by Solomon
himself (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kgs%2011:5">1 Kings
xi, 5</a>; <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kgs%2023:13">2 Kings
xxiii, 13</a>). For more than three hundred years she had her temple in
Jerusalem. And even today devout Jews address orizons to the new moon,
a relic of the worship of Astarte. The rosary is a survival of astral
worship. It was once a symbol of the stars.</p>
<p>The author of &ldquo;Supernatural Religion&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The
belief that sun, moon and stars were living entities possessed of souls
was generally held by the Jews at the beginning of our era.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same belief was entertained by the Christian Fathers. Origen
says: &ldquo;As the stars move with so much order and method that under
no circumstances whatever do their course seem to be disturbed, is it
not the extreme of absurdity to suppose that so much order, so much
observance of discipline and method could be demanded from or fulfilled
by irrational beings?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb468" href=
"#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span></p>
<p>Out of astral worship grew the so-called science of astrology. Of
this &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Astrology
is one of the most ancient forms of superstition, and is found
prevailing among the nations of the East at the very dawn of history.
The Jews became much addicted to it after the Captivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the so-called Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament
reads: &ldquo;There shall come a star out of Jacob&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%2024:17">Num. xxiv,
17</a>). &ldquo;Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the
days of Herod the King, behold, there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we
have seen his star in the east, ... and, lo, the star, which they saw
in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the
young child was&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%202:1-9">Matt. ii, 1,
2, 9</a>). This marvelous event at the advent of the Christian Messiah
was a complete &ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo; of what had been predicted
centuries before concerning the appearance of the expected Persian
Messiah, the original of the expected Messiah of the Jews.</p>
<p>Graves says that the language of Matthew clearly betrays the
astrological origin of his story: &ldquo;The practice of calculating
nativities by the stars was in vogue in the era and country of
Christ&rsquo;s birth, and had been for a long time previously in
various countries. &lsquo;We have seen his star in the east, and have
come to worship him.&rsquo; Now mark, here, it was not the star, nor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span>a star, but &lsquo;his star&rsquo;; thus
disclosing its unmistakable astrological features&rdquo; (Sixteen
Crucified Saviors, p. 53).</p>
<p>After referring to the prevalency of astrology at the beginning of,
and anterior to, the Christian era, Strauss says: &ldquo;When such
ideas were afloat, it was easy to imagine that the birth of the Messiah
must be announced by a star, especially as, according to the common
interpretation of Balaam&rsquo;s prophecy, a star was there made the
symbol of the Messiah. It is certain that the Jewish mind effected this
combination; for it is a rabbinical idea that at the time of the
Messiah&rsquo;s birth a star will appear in the east and remain for a
long time visible.... In the time of Jesus it was the general belief
that stars were always the forerunners of great events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus in the Apocalypse declares himself to be &ldquo;the bright and
morning star&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2022:16">xxii,

(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

His second coming will be heralded by &ldquo;signs in the sun, and in

<h3 class="main">4. Worship of the Elements and Forces of Nature.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The elements and forces of nature, Volney believes,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470</a>]</span>inspired the first ideas of God and
religion:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Man, reflecting on his condition,
began to perceive that he was subjected to forces superior to his own,
and independent of his will. The sun enlightened and warmed him, fire
burned him, thunder terrified him; the wind beat upon him, and water
drowned him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Considering the action of the
elements on him, he conceived the idea of weakness and subjection on
his part, and of power and domination on theirs; and this idea of power
was the primitive and fundamental type of every idea of the
Divinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The action of these natural
existences excited in him sensations of pleasure and pain, of good or
evil; and by a natural effect of his organization he conceived for them
love or aversion; he desired or dreaded their presence; and fear or
hope gave rise to the first idea of religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this elemental worship Indra, Agni, Zeus, Odin, Jehovah and
other gods were evolved. Jehovah was originally a god of the
atmosphere. He manifested himself in the tempest; he unchained the
waves of the sea; the wind was his breath; the thunder was his voice,
the lightning his messenger. He filled the air with frost; he
precipitated the hail; he blanketed the earth with snow; he deluged the
land with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name=
"pb471">471</a>]</span>rain; he congealed the water of the stream, and
parched the verdure of the field.</p>
<p>Fire worship overspread Asia, and Jehovah, like Moloch, became a god
of fire. &ldquo;There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out
of his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>Some vestiges of ancient fire worship have been transmitted to our
time. John Newton says: &ldquo;A sacred fire, at first miraculously
kindled, and subsequently kept up by the sedulous care of priests and
priestesses, formed an important part of the religion of Judea,
Babylonia, Persia. Greece and Rome, and the superstition lingers
amongst us still. So late as the advent of the Reformation, a sacred
fire was kept ever burning on a shrine at Kildare, in Ireland, and
attended by virgins of high rank, called &lsquo;inghean au
dagha,&rsquo; or daughters of fire. Every year is the ceremony repeated
at Jerusalem of the miraculous kindling of the Holy Fire at the reputed
sepulchre, and men and women crowd to light tapers at the sacred
flame&rdquo; (The Assyrian Grove).</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Worship of Animals and Plants.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the infancy of the world animals were deified and
adored, and trees and plants were regarded as sentient beings and
received the homage of man.</p>
<p>Nearly every animal has been an object of worship. This worship
flourished for ages in Egypt and India. In Egypt the worship of the
bull <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474</a>]</span>(Apis) was associated with that of Osiris
(Serapis). The cow is still worshiped in India. Serpent worship has
existed in every part of the world.</p>
<p>Remnants of animal worship survived in Judaism and Christianity.
Satan was a serpent; Jehovah, like Osiris, was worshiped as a bull;
Christ was the lamb of God, and the Holy Ghost appeared in the form of
a dove.</p>
<p>Closely allied to this worship, and to some extent a part of it, is
the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. Some of the Jews believed
in this. So did many of the early Christians, including Origen.</p>
<p>The leek, the lotus, and other plants were held as sacred or divine.
The rose was the divine flower of Greece. Its petals had been dyed with
the blood of her favorite goddess. In many nations the lily was the
sacred emblem of virginity. Christians still attach a sort of
sacredness to it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The groves were God&rsquo;s first
temples,&rdquo; says Bryant. The groves, too, were among man&rsquo;s
first gods. Volumes have been written on the ancient worship of trees.
Not only the Druids of Britain, but the Greeks, and the Semitic races
of Asia were worshipers of trees. The giant oaks and the symmetrical
evergreens were gods. The rustling of the aspen and the moaning of the
pines were the audible whisperings of Divinity which the prophets
interpreted.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The worship of trees,&rdquo; says
Soury, &ldquo;only disappeared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475"
href="#pb475" name="pb475">475</a>]</span>in Syria at a very late
date.... The largest and tallest trees, and the evergreen ones, were
adored as gods. A great many Semitic myths were connected with the
vegetable world. Thus the pomegranate, famous for the richness of its
fruit, was sacred to Adonis and Aphrodite. The almond, which, while
nature seems inanimate, comes forth first from winter&rsquo;s sleep,
the amygdalis, the &lsquo;great mother,&rsquo; gave birth to a crowd of
Semitic legends&rdquo; (Religion of Israel, pp. 66, 67).</p>
<p>The tree, like the serpent, was an emblem of immortality. The Garden
of Eden had its Tree of Life. Newton says: &ldquo;&lsquo;I am come that
they might have Life, and that they might have it abundantly&rsquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2010:10">John x,
10</a>). Life is the reward which has been promised under every system,
including that of the founder of Christianity. A Tree of Life stood in
the midst of that Paradise which is described in the book of Genesis;
... and in a second Paradise, which is promised to the blessed by the
author of the book of Revelation, a tree of life shall stand once more
&lsquo;for the healing of the nations.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There still exist in Palestine venerable trees which receive not
merely the reverence, but the worship of Mussulmans and Christians.
Some of these trees they believe possess divine curative powers.
Travelers have observed them covered with strips of cloth or strings,
which are tied to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476"
name="pb476">476</a>]</span>the twigs. This is done to induce the
spirit of the tree to heal or drive away disease.</p>
<p>Sex worship, as we have seen, bequeathed some of its doctrines and
rites to nearly every religion that has existed since its time. It
became associated with tree worship. The Bible abounds with
&ldquo;sacred groves.&rdquo; In Palestine hundreds of them were
consecrated to Aschera, the favorite goddess of the ancient Jews. These
groves were devoted to sacred prostitution. In some of them the worship
of Baal and Aschera were combined; in others that of Jehovah and
Aschera. &ldquo;These sanctuaries of Aschera,&rdquo; says M. Soury,
&ldquo;were charming spots, shady groves of green trees, often watered
by running streams, mysterious retreats where all was silence save the
cooing of the doves sacred to the goddess. The symbol of Aschera, a
simple pillar, or the trunk of a tree, perhaps with its leaves and
branches, was the emblem of generative power.&rdquo; The spots once
occupied by these groves are still deemed holy ground. Many of them are
marked by Mohammedan mosques and Christian chapels.</p>
<p>The sacred groves of Palestine where devout and voluptuous Jews
mingled the worship of Jehovah and Aschera live, too, in the Protestant
camp meetings of our western world, where, in shady bowers, Christians
worship fervently at the altar of Christ, and then, not infrequently,
meet clandestinely and pay their vows to Aschera. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name="pb477">477</a>]</span></p>
<p>The palm tree, and where the palm did not grow, the pine, both
symbols of the phallus, were worshiped. Newton says:
&ldquo;Palm-branches have been used in all ages as emblems of life,
peace, and victory. They were strewn before Christ. Palm-Sunday, the
feast of palms, is still kept. Even within the present [19th] century,
on this festival, in many towns of France, women and children carried
in procession at the end of their palm-branches a phallus made of
bread, which they called, undisguisedly, &lsquo;la pine,&rsquo; whence
the festival was called &lsquo;La Fete des Pinnes.&rsquo; The
&lsquo;pine&rsquo; having been blest by the priest, the women carefully
preserved it during the following year as an amulet&rdquo; (The
Assyrian Grove).</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Fetichism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Closely related to the foregoing worship is fetichism,
the worship of idols and images. This is popularly supposed to be the
religion only of savages and barbarians; but it also prevails to some
extent among people who are considered civilized and enlightened.</p>
<p>While it was opposed by some of the kings, priests, and prophets,
idolatry flourished among the Jews from the earliest ages down almost
to the Christian era. Abraham&rsquo;s father, Terah, was an idolater

<p>The fetichism of Christ&rsquo;s ancestors reappeared in the image
worship of his devotees. The Christians of the middle ages, Dr. Draper
says, &ldquo;were immersed in fetichism.&rdquo; &ldquo;The worship of
images, of fragments of the cross, or bones, nails and other relics, a
true fetich worship, was cultivated&rdquo; (Conflict, p. 49). &ldquo;A
chip of the true cross, some iron filings from the chain of St. Peter,
a tooth or bone of a martyr, were held in adoration; the world was full
of the stupendous miracles which these relics had performed. But
especially were painted or graven images of holy personages supposed to
be endowed with such powers. They had become objects of actual
worship&rdquo; (Intellectual Development of Europe, vol. i, p.
414).</p>
<p>Concerning the fetichism of the church, &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s
Encyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;It was usual not only to keep lights
and burn incense before the images, to kiss them reverently; and to
kneel down and pray before them, but some went so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href="#pb479" name="pb479">479</a>]</span>far
as to make the images serve as godfathers and godmothers in baptism,
and even to mingle the dust of the coloring matter scraped from the
images with the Eucharist elements in the Holy Communion.... In many
foreign churches, especially in Italy, in southern Germany, and in
France [at the present time], are to be found images which are
popularly reputed as especially sacred, and to which, or to prayers
offered before which, miraculous effects are ascribed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Newton, of England, admits and deplores the existence of
Christian fetichism. He says: &ldquo;The consecrating and bowing down
to images; the attributing of miraculous powers and virtues to idols;
the setting up of little oratories, altars and statues in the streets
and highways and on the tops of mountains; the carrying of images and
relics in pompous procession, ... all these are equally parts of pagan
and popish superstition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greek, Lutheran, and Anglican churches are not free from fetichism,
and even the Evangelical churches of this country make a fetich of a
book.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Polytheism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Polytheism, the doctrine of a plurality of gods, has
prevailed in every part of the world. The most interesting pantheons of
the gods were those of India, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The Hebrews, who
were polytheists, borrowed their gods from Assyria and Babylonia. The
pantheon of these nations comprised twelve principal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name="pb480">480</a>]</span>gods
and nearly a thousand minor deities. The chief of these gods was El.
His consort was Elath. The Hebrews worshiped El under the name of El
Shaddai and various other names. Elohim of the Bible, translated God,
denotes the plural and included El and the minor gods who surrounded
him. Yahweh, Iahveh, Jehovah, etc., as he is variously called&mdash;for
Jews and Christians cannot spell and do not even know the name of their
principal deity&mdash;is a god of Assyro-Babylonian origin. In addition
to their national god, Jehovah, many of the Jews worshiped Baal,
Moloch, and Tammouz, male deities, and Astarte, Aschera, and Istar,
female deities.</p>
<p>That the writers of the Bible recognized a plurality of
gods&mdash;were polytheists&mdash;is proved by the following:
&ldquo;And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of
us&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%203:22">Gen. iii,

(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2015:11">Ex. xv,

Lord&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2086:8">Ps. lxxxvi,

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2095:3">Ps. xcv,

"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2022:28">Ex. xxii,
28</a>).</p>
<p>Monotheism, the doctrine of one god, is not merely the worship of
one god, but the belief in the existence of one god only. Many were
monotheistic in worship&mdash;worshiped one god, their national
deity&mdash;while at the same time they were polytheistic in
belief&mdash;believed in the existence of many gods. The Jews who
worshiped Jehovah <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481"
name="pb481">481</a>]</span>have been called monotheists. And yet, for
a thousand years, they believed in the existence of Kemosh, Baal,
Moloch, Tammouz, and other deities. They believed that Jehovah was
their national god and that they owed allegiance to him; just as the
subjects of an earthly king profess their loyalty to him without
denying the existence of other kings.</p>
<p>While Christians profess Monotheism they are really
polytheists&mdash;worship three gods&mdash;Father (Jehovah), Son
(Christ), and Holy Ghost; and recognize a god of Evil, Satan. To these
must also be added a female deity, the Virgin Mary, who is to the
devout Catholic as much of a divinity as Isis and Venus were to ancient
polytheists. The canonization and adoration of the saints, too, are
analogous to the worship of the inferior deities of ancient times.</p>
<p>After recounting what he believes to be the salutary influences
exerted by the medieval conception of the Virgin, Lecky says:
&ldquo;But the price, and perhaps the necessary price, of this was the
exaltation of the Virgin as an omnipresent deity of infinite power as
well as infinite condescension. The legends represented her as
performing every kind of prodigy.... The painters depicted her invested
with the divine aureole, judging men on equal terms with her Son, or
even retaining her ascendancy over him in heaven. In the devotions of
the people she was addressed in terms identical with those employed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href="#pb482" name=
"pb482">482</a>]</span>to the Almighty. A reverence similar in kind but
less in degree was soon bestowed upon the other saints, who speedily
assumed the position of the minor deities of Paganism&rdquo; (History
of Rationalism, Vol. I, pp. 226, 227).</p>
<p>Regarding the deification and worship of saints Hallam says:
&ldquo;Every cathedral or monastery had its tutelar saint, and every
saint his legend, fabricated in order to enrich the churches under his
protection, by exaggerating his virtues, his miracles, and consequently
his power of serving those who paid liberally for his patronage. Many
of those saints were imaginary persons; sometimes a blundered
inscription added a name to the calendar; and sometimes, it is said, a
heathen god was surprised at the company to which he was introduced,
and the rites with which he was honored&rdquo; (Middle Ages, p.
603).</p>
<p>The church historian Mosheim admits and deplores the truth of this:
&ldquo;It is, at the same time, as undoubtedly certain, as it is
extravagant and monstrous, that the worship of the martyrs was modeled,
by degrees, according to the religious services that were paid to the
gods before the coming of Christ&rdquo; (Ecclesiastical History, p.
98).</p>
<p>Bishop Newton says: &ldquo;The very same temples, the very same
images, which were once consecrated to Jupiter and the other demons
[gods], are now consecrated to the Virgin Mary and the other
saints.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483" name=
"pb483">483</a>]</span></p>
<p>Milman says that at an early period &ldquo;Christianity began to
approach to a polytheistic form, or at least to permit what it is
difficult to call by any other name than polytheistic, habits and
feelings of devotion&rdquo; (History of Christianity, Vol. III, p.
424).</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Monotheism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Monotheism, as previously stated, is the doctrine of
one god only. It has gradually displaced, to a great extent, the
fetichism and polytheism of earlier times.</p>
<p>Comte&rsquo;s law of human development is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1<span class="corr" id="xd21e13745" title="Not in source">.</span>
Theological, or fictitious,</li>
<li>2. Metaphysical, or abstract,</li>
<li>3. Scientific, or positive.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In the Theological state, the
human mind, seeking the essential nature of things, the first and final
causes (the origin and purpose) of all effects&mdash;in short Absolute
knowledge&mdash;supposes all phenomena to be produced by the immediate
action of supernatural beings.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In the Metaphysical state, which
is only a modification of the first, the mind supposes, instead of
supernatural beings, abstract forms, veritable entities (that is,
personified abstractions) inherent in all things, and capable of
producing all phenomena.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In the final, the Positive state,
the mind has given over the vain search after Absolute notions, the
origin and destination of the universe, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb484" href="#pb484" name="pb484">484</a>]</span>and the causes of
phenomena, and applies itself to the study of their laws&mdash;that is,
their invariable relations of succession and resemblance&rdquo;
(Positive Philosophy, pp. 26, 27).</p>
<p>The lowest state of human development is the theological. Here the
masses of mankind still repose. Only the scholars and thinkers have
advanced beyond this and many of these have only reached the second or
metaphysical state.</p>
<p>The highest point in the theological state is monotheism. To Judaism
Christians ascribe the glory of having been the first religion to teach
a pure monotheism. But monotheism existed long before the Jews attained
to it. Zoroaster and his earliest followers were monotheists, dualism
being a later development of the Persian theology. The adoption of
monotheism by the Jews, which occurred only at a very late period in
their history, was not, however, the result of a divine revelation, or
even of an intellectual superiority, for the Jews were immeasurably
inferior intellectually to the Greeks and Romans, to the Hindus and
Egyptians, and to the Assyrians and Babylonians, who are supposed to
have retained a belief in polytheism. This monotheism of the Jews was
chiefly the result of a religious intolerance never before equaled and
never since surpassed, except in the history of Christianity and
Mohammedanism, the daughters of Judaism. Jehovistic priests and kings
tolerated no rivals of their god and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb485" href="#pb485" name="pb485">485</a>]</span>made death the
penalty for disloyalty to him. The Jewish nation became monotheistic
for the same reason that Spain, in the clutches of the Inquisition,
became entirely Christian.</p>
<p>Jesus of Nazareth and his disciples, if they existed, were probably
monotheists, believed that Jehovah was the only God, and neither
believed nor claimed that Jesus was other than the son of man. As
generations passed the man became obscured, his deeds were magnified
until at length he was accepted as the Son of God, and a God himself.
The deification of Jesus, then, together with the apotheosis of other
mortals, cannot be regarded as an evolution from Jewish monotheism to a
higher plane, but rather as a relapse from monotheism to
polytheism.</p>

<h3 class="main">9. The Mediatorial Idea.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This idea had its origin chiefly in the worship of the
elements and forces of nature by primitive man. He believed that these
elements and forces were intelligent beings. He realized that in their
presence he was in a measure helpless. He therefore sought to win their
favor and appease their wrath. He made offerings to them; he prayed to
them; he worshiped them. But other men, more wise, more cunning, and
more fortunate, appeared to have greater influence with these deities.
He employed them to intercede for him; and thus the priesthood was
established. The priest was the first mediator.</p>
<p>More complex religious systems were in time <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=
"pb486">486</a>]</span>evolved, and in some of them mediatorial gods
appeared. The mediatorial idea was prominent in the Persian system.
Mithra was the Persian mediator. The worship of Mithra was carried to
Rome and the Romans became acquainted with the mediatorial idea. In an
exposition of Philo&rsquo;s philosophy, Mrs. Evans says: &ldquo;The
most exalted spirits are able to raise themselves to the pure essence
and find peace and joy which earthly conditions cannot disturb; but
weaker natures need a helper in a Being, who, coming from above, can
dwell below and lift their souls to God. The majority of mankind, in
their passage along the slippery path of life, are sure to fall, and
would perish if it were not for a mediator between themselves and
God.... The power of the Caesars, culminating in Augustus, enabled them
to claim divine honors from the people, already disposed to see in them
chosen agents of celestial sovereignty. Rome, according to the
expression of Valerius Maximus, recognized in the Caesars the mediators
between heaven and earth. And that was before Christianity introduced
its anointed mediator&rdquo; (The Christ Myth, pp. 90, 92).</p>
<p>The God of the Jews, to quote the words of Jefferson, was
&ldquo;cruel, vindictive, capricious and unjust.&rdquo; He had cursed
his creation; he had drowned a world; he had imposed the sentence of
death&mdash;spiritual as well as physical&mdash;upon his children. To
placate this monster, to induce <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb487"
href="#pb487" name="pb487">487</a>]</span>him to remit this sentence,
the priests were powerless. Millions of animals, and even human beings,
had been sacrificed to him in vain. At length his &ldquo;only begotten
son,&rdquo; Jesus Christ, offered himself as a sacrifice to atone for
the sins of the world. The sacrifice was accepted, and a reconciliation
was effected between God and man. Thus Christ became the great mediator
of Christianity. &ldquo;There is one God, and one mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<h3 class="main">10. The Messianic Idea.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The desire for a deliverer naturally arises in the
minds of a people who are in subjection and bondage. This desire was
the germ of the Messianic idea. While there are traces of this idea in
the earlier writings of the Hebrews, it reached its highest development
during and immediately following the Captivity, and again in the
Maccabean age.</p>
<p>The Messiah of Judaism and the Messiah, or Christ, of Christianity,
were derived from the Persian theology, the adherents of each system
modifying the doctrine to suit their respective notions. In its article
on Zoroaster, &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclopedia&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;There is an important element to be noticed, viz., the Messiah,
or Sosiosh, from whom the Jewish and Christian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb488" href="#pb488" name=
"pb488">488</a>]</span>notions of a Messiah are held by many to have
been derived.... Even a superficial glance at this sketch will show our
readers what very close parallels between Jewish and Christian notions
on the one hand, and the Zoroastrian on the other, are to be
drawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christians cite numerous passages from the writings of the Old
Testament which they claim foretold the advent of Jesus. Not one of
these passages, as originally penned, refers in the remotest degree to
him, though many of them do refer to the office he is said to have
filled. The Jews hoped for a deliverer, for a national leader who would
reestablish the kingdom of Israel, and restore to it the glory of
David&rsquo;s reign. They were loyal to the house of David and believed
that this deliverer would be a descendant, a son, of David. Pietists,
too, in the fervor of their religious enthusiasm dreamed of universal
conversion to the Jehovistic theocracy. In the writings of their
prophets and poets these hopes and dreams found expression. &ldquo;I
have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David, my
servant, thy seed will I establish forever, and build up thy throne to
all generations&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2039:3-4">Ps. xxxix,
3, 4</a>). &ldquo;And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of
the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the
saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and
all dominions shall serve and obey him&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dn%207:27">Dan. vii,
27</a>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489" name=
"pb489">489</a>]</span></p>
<p>While the Messianic idea was originally a Persian idea, the
materials used in the formation of the Christian Messiah were drawn
largely from the Jewish Scriptures. There are passages in the Old
Testament, as we have seen, which predict the coming of a Messiah.
These furnished a portion of the materials out of which this Messianic
deity, Christ, was formed. There are many more which have no reference
whatever to a Messiah which have been made to serve as Messianic
prophecies. The Old Testament, as we have it, is alleged to be a Jewish
work. It is, rather, a Christian work. It is a Christian version of
ancient Jewish writings, every book of which has been more or less
Christianized. Much of it is scarcely recognizable to a Jewish scholar.
This is especially true of so-called Messianic prophecies.</p>
<p>The Christian Messiah was, on the one hand, modeled, to a
considerable extent, after the Jewish ideal, while the Jewish
materials, on the other hand, were freely altered to fit the new
conception. Referring to the work of the Evangelists, M. Renan says:
&ldquo;Sometimes they reasoned thus: &lsquo;The Messiah ought to do
such a thing; now Jesus is the Messiah, therefore Jesus has done such a
thing.&rsquo; At other times, by an inverse process, it was said:
&lsquo;Such a thing has happened to Jesus; now Jesus is the Messiah;
therefore such a thing was to happen to the Messiah.&rsquo;&rdquo;
(Jesus, p. 27). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490" href="#pb490"
name="pb490">490</a>]</span></p>
<p>That the so-called Messianic prophecies of the Jewish Scriptures
were the immediate source of the Christ is apparent. That he was,
however, merely a borrowed idea and not a historical realization of
these prophecies is equally apparent. The Jews were expecting a
Messiah. Had Jesus realized these expectations they would have accepted
him. But he did not realize them. These prophecies were not fulfilled
in him. He was not a son of David; he did not deliver his race from
bondage; he did not become a king; the important events that were to
attend and follow Messiah&rsquo;s advent form no part even of his
alleged history. His rejection by the Jews proves him to be either a
false Messiah, or an imaginary being&mdash;a historical myth, or a pure
myth&mdash;in either case a myth.</p>
<p>The Jewish argument against Jesus as the Messiah is unanswerable:
&ldquo;We do not find in the present comparatively imperfect stage of
human progress the realization of that blessed condition of mankind
which the prophet Isaiah associates with the era when Messiah is to
appear. And as our Hebrew Scriptures speak of one Messianic advent
only, and not of two advents; and as the inspired Book does not preach
Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom as a matter of faith, but distinctly identifies
it with matters of fact which are to be made evident to the senses, we
cling to the plain inference to be drawn from the text of the Bible,
and we deny that Messiah has yet appeared, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name="pb491">491</a>]</span>and
upon the following grounds: First, because of the three distinctive
facts which the inspired seer of Judah inseparably connects with the
advent of the Messiah, viz., (1) the cessation of war and the
uninterrupted reign of peace, (2) the prevalence of a perfect concord
of opinion on all matters bearing upon the worship of the one and only
God, and (3) the ingathering of the remnant of Judah and of the
dispersed ten tribes of Israel&mdash;not one has, up to the present
time, been accomplished. Second, we dissent from the proposition that
Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah announced by the prophets, because the
church which he founded, and which his successors developed, has
offered, during a succession of centuries, most singular contrast to
what is described by the Hebrew Scriptures as the immediate consequence
of Messiah&rsquo;s advent, and of his glorious kingdom. The prophet
Isaiah declares that when the Messiah appears, peace, love, and union
will be permanently established; and every candid man must admit that
the world has not realized the accomplishment of this prophecy. Again,
in the days of Messiah, all men, as Scripture saith, &lsquo;are to
serve God with one accord&rsquo;; and yet it is very certain that since
the appearance of him whom Christians believe to be Messiah, mankind
has been split into more hostile divisions on the ground of religious
belief, and more antagonistic sects have sprung up, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name="pb492">492</a>]</span>than
in any historic age before Christianity was preached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With orthodox Jews the belief in a Messiah is a deep rooted
conviction. For 2500 years there has been displayed in front of the
synagogue this sign: &ldquo;Wanted&mdash;a Messiah.&rdquo; During this
time many, including Jesus, Bar-Cocheba, Moses of Candia, and Sabatai
Zevi, have applied for the place, but all applicants have been
rejected, and the Messianic predictions of the Jewish prophets are yet
to be fulfilled. So, too, are those of the Persian prophet. In the
meantime the followers of Jesus&mdash;turning from the Jews to the
Gentiles&mdash;have from this borrowed idea evolved a deity who divides
with Brahma, Buddha, and Allah, the worship of the world.</p>

<h3 class="main">11. The Logos (Word).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The exaltation and deification of Jesus is thus
described by the Dutch theologian, Dr. Hooykaas: &ldquo;When Jesus was
gone, those who had known him personally insensibly surrounded him with
a glory that shone at last with a more than human splendor. The
spiritual blessings which flowed in ever rich measure from his person
and his gospel compelled the Christians to exalt him ever more and
more. The title of Son of God, which his followers had given him as the
future Messiah, was elastic and ambiguous enough to lend itself very
readily to this process. The idea of his being the Messiah now no
longer sufficed; he was something other and something <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name="pb493">493</a>]</span>far
more than the Jewish Messiah. The philosophy and theology of the day
were laid under contribution; and nothing could so well indicate his
significance for all humanity and his unapproachable exaltation as the
idea that he was the Word&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, Vol. III, pp.
670, 671).</p>
<p>The doctrine of the Logos, or Word, as an emanation or essence of
divine wisdom is very old. It is found in the ancient religions of
Egypt and India. It was recognized in the Persian theology, and was
incorporated into the Jewish theology by the Babylonian exiles. It
constitutes an important element in the Platonic philosophy. It
received its highest development and exposition in the writings of the
Jewish philosopher Philo, a contemporary of Jesus.</p>
<p>Concerning the Logos, Dean Milman, in his &ldquo;History of
Christianity,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;This Being was more or less
distinctly impersonated, according to the more popular or more
philosophic, the more material or the more abstract, notions of the age
of the people. This was the doctrine from the Ganges, or even the
shores of the Yellow Sea, to the Ilissus: it was the fundamental
principle of the Indian religion and the Indian philosophy; it was the
basis of Zoroastrianism; it was pure Platonism; it was the Platonic
Judaism of the Alexandrian school.&rdquo; Another English clergyman,
Mr. Lake, says: &ldquo;We can trace its [the Word&rsquo;s] birthplace
in the philosophic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href="#pb494"
name="pb494">494</a>]</span>speculations of the ancient world; we can
note its gradual development and growth; we can see it in its early
youth passing (through Philo and others), from Grecian philosophy into
the current of Jewish thought&rdquo; (Philo, Plato, and Paul, p.
71).</p>
<p>The presentation of Jesus as an incarnation of the Logos belongs to
the second century and is prominent in the Fourth Gospel. The ideas are
chiefly those of Plato and Philo. Plato&rsquo;s trinity was Thought,
Word and Deed. The Word occupies the second place in the Platonic
trinity as it does in the Christian trinity. That the author of the
gospel of John, written more than a century after the time of Philo,
borrowed largely from that philosopher, is shown by the following
parallels drawn from their writings:</p>
<p>Philo.&mdash;&ldquo;The Logos is the Son of God&rdquo; (De

<h3 class="main">12. The Perfect Man.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The New Testament contains at least five different
mythical types or conceptions of Jesus Christ: 1. The Messiah of the
synoptics, omitting the opening chapters of Matthew and Luke. 2. The
Son of God, or demi-god, introduced in these opening chapters. 3. The
incarnate Logos or God of John. 4. The Christ of Paul. 5. Eliminating
these more or less supernatural types, there remains in these writings,
in addition to the purely natural and purely human Jesus of Nazareth, a
type known as the Ideal or Perfect Alan. This type is not only
mythical, but, in the stricter sense, supernatural and superhuman; for
the perfect man must always remain an ideal rather than a real type of
man.</p>
<p>The last type is believed by many to represent the primal stage in
the deification of Jesus. This conception of Jesus has been held by
many Rationalistic Christians, and by some conservative Rationalists in
all ages. This, too, forms a part of the dualistic conception of Christ
entertained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=
"pb496">496</a>]</span>by orthodox Christians, a conception which
supposes him to have combined in his incarnation both a human and a
divine element which made him both man and God. The portrayal of the
vicarious suffering and death of this man has been one of the most
powerful agents in the propagation of Christianity.</p>
<p>The molders of primitive Christianity were greatly influenced by
various philosophical speculations&mdash;by the teachings of Pythagoras
and Plato among the earlier, and by the writings of Philo and Seneca
among the later philosophers. To Philo, we have seen, they were
indebted largely for the Logos; to Seneca they were indebted chiefly
for the Ideal or Perfect Man. The following extracts are from
&ldquo;The Christ Myth&rdquo; of Mrs. Evans:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Seneca advises the cherishing of a
hope that victory in the form of a wise man will finally appear,
because humanity requires that the exemplification of perfection should
be visible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Seneca&rsquo;s conception of
perfect humanity was a combination of the wise man of the Platonists
and Stoics and the gentle sufferer who endures insult and
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Logos of Philo was too
ethereal to answer all the demands of feeble humanity. The God-man must
live and suffer and die among and for the people in order to make the
sacrifice complete.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb497" href=
"#pb497" name="pb497">497</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Philo endowed the Logos of
Heraclitus with the authority of a priestly mediator, who, floating
between earth and heaven, brings God and man together; Seneca places
this mediator as a suffering man among men. Philo, from his Jewish
standpoint, made the Logos the priestly intercessor; Seneca, from the
standpoint of his Stoical society, believed in the possibility of a
perfect man as savior and guide of weaker men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cognizant of the striking resemblance between some of the writings
of the New Testament and the writings of the Stoics, particularly of
Seneca, modern Christian apologists affect to believe that this
philosopher was acquainted with the history and the gospel of Christ.
But the Stoical philosophy propounded by Seneca had been forming ever
since the time of Zeno, three centuries before the time of Christ.
Seneca himself was born before the Christian era, and no part of the
New Testament was in existence when he wrote. Relative to this
contention Lecky writes: &ldquo;It is admitted that the greatest
moralists of the Roman empire either never mentioned Christianity, or
mentioned it with contempt.... The Jews, with whom the Christians were
then identified, he (Seneca) emphatically describes as &lsquo;an
accursed race.&rsquo;&rdquo; (European Morals, vol. 1, pp. 340, 342).
During the second and third centuries Christian scholars ransacked
Pagan literature for recognitions of Christ and Christianity. Regarding
this, Lecky <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498" name=
"pb498">498</a>]</span>says: &ldquo;At the time, when the passion for
discovering these connections was most extravagant, the notion of
Seneca and his followers being inspired by the Christians was
unknown&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 346). Gibbon says: &ldquo;The new sect
[Christians] is totally unnoticed by Seneca&rdquo; (Rome, vol. i, 587,
note).</p>
<p>Out of all these various religious systems and doctrines&mdash;out
of sex worship and sun worship&mdash;out of the worship of the stars
and the worship of the elements&mdash;out of the worship of animals and
the worship of idols&mdash;out of Polytheism and Monotheism&mdash;out
of the Mediatorial and Messianic ideas&mdash;out of the Logos and the
Ideal Man of the philosophers&mdash;this Christ has come. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Sources of the Christ Myth&mdash;Pagan
Divinities.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the preceding chapter I have noticed some of the
typical religious systems and beliefs from which Christ and
Christianity were to a great extent derived. I shall next notice more
particularly some of the so-called divine beings&mdash;some of the
gods, and some of the mortals endowed with supernatural gifts,
belonging to these systems. I shall show that there were many sons of
gods besides Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;only begotten Son&rdquo;; that each
of them possessed some attribute possessed by him; that all of them
lived or existed in the minds of men, centuries before his time; and
that many of them were prototypes of him, and furnished in a large
degree the ideas which suggested him, or which are associated with him
and his religion. My list will comprise the following, all of whom were
believed by their worshipers or followers to be of divine descent:
Krishna, Buddha, Confucius, <span class="corr" id="xd21e13914" title=

Adonis, Osiris, Horus, Zeus, Apollo, Perseus, Hercules, Dionysos,

<h3 class="main">Krishna.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Krishna was the eighth Avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu, one of the Hindoo Trinity. In this incarnation Vishnu, it
is said, &ldquo;appeared in all the fullness of his power and
glory.&rdquo; His mother was Devaki. He is believed to be a historical
character, but his real history, like that of Jesus, is almost entirely
obscured by myths. He lived from 900 to 1,200 years before the
Christian era. The story of his life is to be found in the
&ldquo;Bhagavat,&rdquo; one of the &ldquo;Puranas,&rdquo; while his
religious teachings are given in the &ldquo;Bhagavad-Gita,&rdquo; a
poem belonging to the &ldquo;Mahabarata.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The points of resemblance between Krishna and Christ that have been
printed would fill a volume. Some of these are apocryphal, and not
confirmed by the canonical scriptures of India. The limits of this
chapter preclude an extended list even of the undoubtedly genuine. I
shall confine myself chiefly to a presentation of the most important
ones relating to their births. These, according to the Christian
translator of the &ldquo;Bhagavat Purana,&rdquo; Rev. Thomas Maurice,
are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Both were miraculously conceived.</p>
<p>2. Both were divine incarnations.</p>
<p>3. Both were of royal descent.</p>
<p>4. Devatas or angels sang songs of praise at the birth of each.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb501" href="#pb501" name=
"pb501">501</a>]</span></p>
<p>5. Both were visited by neighboring shepherds.</p>
<p>6. In both cases the reigning monarch, fearing that he would be
supplanted in his kingdom by the divine child, sought to destroy
him.</p>
<p>7. Both were saved by friends who fled with them in the night to
distant countries.</p>
<p>8. Foiled in their attempts to discover the babes both kings issued
decrees that all the infants should be put to death.</p>
<p>Writing of Krishna in the eighteenth century, Sir William Jones
says: &ldquo;In the Sanscrit dictionary, compiled more than two
thousand years ago, we have the whole history of the incarnate deity,
born of a virgin, and miraculously escaping in infancy from the
reigning tyrant of his country&rdquo; (Asiatic Researches, Vol. I, p.
273).</p>
<p>The subsequent careers of these deities are analogous in many
respects. Their missions were the same&mdash;the salvation of mankind.
Both performed miracles&mdash;healed the sick and raised the dead. Both
died for man by man. There is a tradition, though not to be found in
the Hindoo scriptures, that Krishna, like Christ, was crucified.</p>
<p>Various incidents recorded in the life of Christ were doubtless
suggested by similar incidents in the life of Krishna. He washed the
feet of his disciples because Krishna had washed the feet of the
Brahmins. He taught his disciples the possibility of removing a
mountain, because Krishna, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href=
"#pb502" name="pb502">502</a>]</span>to protect his worshipers from the
wrath of Indra, raised Mount Goverdhen above them. His parents in their
flight with him, as related in the Gospel of the Infancy, stopped at a
place called Maturea. Krishna was born at Mathura.</p>
<p>The earliest followers of each were from the lower classes of
society, those of Krishna being herdsmen and milkmaids. Christ&rsquo;s
most ardent worshipers have from the first been women.
&ldquo;Chrishna,&rdquo; to quote the authority last mentioned,
&ldquo;continues to this hour the darling god of the women of
India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cyclopedia&rdquo; notes the
following events in the history of Krishna which correspond with those
related of Christ: &ldquo;That he was miraculously born at midnight of
a human mother, and saluted by a chorus of Devatas [angels]; that he
was cradled among cowherds, during which period of life he was
persecuted by the giant Kansa, and saved by his mother&rsquo;s flight;
the miracles with which his life abounds, among which were the raising
of the dead and the cleansing of the leprous&rdquo; (Art. Krishna).</p>
<p>The celebrated missionary and traveler, Pere Huc, who made a journey
of several thousand miles through China and Thibet, says: &ldquo;If we
addressed a Mogul or Thibetan this question, Who is Krishna? the reply
was instantly, &lsquo;The savior of men.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;All that
converting the Hindoos to Christianity does for them,&rdquo; says
Robert <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name=
"pb503">503</a>]</span>Cheyne, &ldquo;is to change the object of their
worship from Krishna to Christ.&rdquo; Of Krishna&rsquo;s gospel, the
&ldquo;Bhagavad-Gita,&rdquo; &ldquo;Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclopedia&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;Its correspondence with the New Testament is indeed
striking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parallels between Krishna and Christ to be found in the Hindoo
scriptures and the Christian Gospels are too numerous and too exact to
be accidental. The legends of the one were borrowed from the other. It
is admitted by Christian scholars that Krishna lived many centuries
before Christ. To admit the priority of the Krishna legends is to deny,
to this extent, the originality of the Gospels. To break the force of
the logical conclusion to be drawn from this some argue that while
Krishna himself antedated Christ, the legends concerning him are of
later origin and borrowed from the Evangelists. Regarding this
contention Judge Waite, in his &ldquo;History of the Christian
Religion,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Here then, we have the older religion and
the older god. This, in the absence of any evidence on the other side,
ought to settle the question. To assume without evidence that the older
religion has been interpolated from the later, and that the legends of
the older hero have been made to conform to the history of a later
character, is worse than illogical&mdash;it is absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir William Jones, one of the best Christian authorities on Sanscrit
literature, and the translator of the &ldquo;Bhagavad-Gita,&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;That the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href=
"#pb504" name="pb504">504</a>]</span>name of Krishna, and the general
outline of his history, were long anterior to the birth of our Savior,
and probably to the time of Homer [950 B. C.], we know very
certainly&rdquo; (Asiatic Researches, Vol. I, p. 254).</p>

<h3 class="main">Buddha.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ninth incarnation of Vishnu was Buddha. The word
Buddha, like the word Christ, is not a name, but a title. It means
&ldquo;the enlightened one.&rdquo; The name of this religious founder
was Siddhartha Gautama. He was born about 643 B. C., and died 563 B. C.
His mother, Mahamaya, was a virgin. Dean Milman, in his &ldquo;History
of Christianity,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Budh, according to a tradition
known in the West, was born of a virgin&rdquo; (Vol. I, p. 99, note).
Devaki, Mary, and Mahamaya, all gave birth to their children among
strangers. Krishna was born in a prison, Christ in a stable, and Buddha
in a garden. &ldquo;Werner&rsquo;s Encyclopedia,&rdquo; in its article
on Buddha, speaks of &ldquo;the marvelous stories which gathered round
the belief in his voluntary incarnation, the miracles at his birth, the
prophecies of the aged saint at his formal presentation to his father,
and how nature altered her course to keep a shadow over his cradle,
whilst the sages from afar came and worshiped him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Tripitaka,&rdquo; the principal Bible of the Buddhists,
containing the history and teachings of Buddha, is a collection of
books written in the centuries immediately following Buddha. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb505" href="#pb505" name=
"pb505">505</a>]</span>canon was finally determined at the Council of
Pataliputra, held under the auspices of the Emperor Asoka the Great,
244 B. C., more than 600 years before the Christian canon was
established. The &ldquo;Lalita Vistara,&rdquo; the sacred book of the
Northern Buddhists, was written long before the Christian era.</p>
<p>Buddha was &ldquo;about 30 years old&rdquo; when he began his
ministry. He fasted &ldquo;seven times seven nights and days.&rdquo; He
had a &ldquo;band of disciples&rdquo; who accompanied him. He traveled
from place to place and &ldquo;preached to large multitudes.&rdquo;
Bishop Bigandet calls his first sermon the &ldquo;Sermon on the
Mount.&rdquo; At his Renunciation &ldquo;he forsook father and mother,
wife and child.&rdquo; His mission was &ldquo;to establish the kingdom
of righteousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Buddha,&rdquo; says Max Muller,
&ldquo;promised salvation to all; and he commanded his disciples to
preach his doctrine in all places and to all men.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Self-conquest and universal charity&rdquo; are the fundamental
principles of his religion. He enjoined humility, and commanded his
followers to conceal their charities. &ldquo;Return good for
evil&rdquo;; &ldquo;overcome anger with love&rdquo;; &ldquo;love your
enemies,&rdquo; were some of his precepts.</p>
<p>Buddha formulated the following commandments: &ldquo;Not to kill;
not to steal; not to lie; not to commit adultery; not to use strong
drink.&rdquo; Christ said: &ldquo;Thou knowest the commandments, do not
commit adultery; do not kill; do not steal; do not bear false witness;
honor thy father and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb506" href="#pb506"
name="pb506">506</a>]</span>thy mother (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2018:20">Luke xviii,
20</a>). Christ ignored the Decalogue of Moses and, like Buddha,
presented a pentade which, with the exception of one commandment, is
the same as that of Buddha.</p>
<p>Prof. Seydel, of the University of Leipsic, points out fifty
analogies between Christianity and Buddhism. Dr. Schleiden calls
attention to over one hundred. Baron Harden-Hickey says:
&ldquo;Countless analogies exist between the Buddhistic and Christian
legends&mdash;analogies so striking that they forcibly prove to an
impartial mind that a common origin must necessarily be given to the
teachings of Sakay-Muni and those of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the biographical accounts of the two religious teachers
Harden-Hickey says: &ldquo;One account must necessarily be a copy of
the other, and since the Buddhist biographer, living long before the
birth of Christ, could not have borrowed from the Christian one, the
plain inference is that the early creed-mongers of Alexandria were
guilty of an act of plagiarism.&rdquo; The following are some of the
parallels presented by this writer:</p>
<p>Both have genealogies tracing their descent from ancestral
kings.</p>
<p>Both were born of virgin mothers.</p>
<p>The conception of each was announced by a divine messenger.</p>
<p>The hymns uttered at the two annunciations resemble each other.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb507" href="#pb507" name=
"pb507">507</a>]</span></p>
<p>Both were visited by wise men who brought them gifts.</p>
<p>Both were presented in the temple.</p>
<p>The aged Simeon of the one account corresponds to the aged Asita of
the other.</p>
<p>As &ldquo;the child (Jesus) grew and waxed strong in spirit,&rdquo;
so &ldquo;the child (Sakay-Muni) waxed and increased in
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both in childhood discoursed before teachers.</p>
<p>Both fasted in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Both were tempted.</p>
<p>Angels or devatas ministered to each.</p>
<p>Buddha bathed in the Narajana, and Christ was baptized in the
Jordan.</p>
<p>The mission of each was proclaimed by a voice from heaven.</p>
<p>Both performed miracles.</p>
<p>Both sent out disciples to propagate their faiths.</p>
<p>In calling their disciples the command of each was, &ldquo;Follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buddha preached on the Holy Hill, and Christ delivered his sermon on
the Mount.</p>
<p>The phraseology of the sermons of Buddha and the sermon ascribed to
Christ is, in many instances, the same.</p>
<p>Both Buddha and Christ compare themselves to husbandmen sowing
seed.</p>
<p>The story of the prodigal son is found in both Scriptures.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb508" href="#pb508" name=
"pb508">508</a>]</span></p>
<p>The account of the man born blind is common to both.</p>
<p>In both the mustard seed is used as a simile for littleness.</p>
<p>Christ speaks of &ldquo;a foolish man, which built his house upon
the sand&rdquo;; Buddha says, &ldquo;Perishable is the city built of
sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both speak of &ldquo;the rain which falls on the just and on the
unjust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story of the ruler, Nicodemus, who came to Jesus by night, has
its parallel in the story of the rich man who came to Buddha by
night.</p>
<p>A converted courtezan, Magdalena, followed Jesus, and a converted
courtezan, Ambapali, followed Buddha.</p>
<p>There is a legend of a traitor connected with each.</p>
<p>Both made triumphal entries, Christ into Jerusalem, and Buddha into
Rajagriba.</p>
<p>Both proclaimed kingdoms not of this world.</p>
<p>The eternal life promised by Christ corresponds to the eternal
peace, Nirvana, promised by Buddha.</p>
<p>Both religions recognize a trinity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Catholic and Protestant
missionaries,&rdquo; to quote Max Muller again, &ldquo;vie with each
other in their praises of Buddha.&rdquo; Bishop Bigandet, one of the
leading Christian writers on Buddha, says: &ldquo;In reading the
particulars of the life of Buddha it is impossible not to feel reminded
of many circumstances relating to our Savior&rsquo;s life as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb509" href="#pb509" name=
"pb509">509</a>]</span>sketched by the evangelists. It may be said in
favor of Buddhism that no philosophic-religious system has ever upheld
to an equal degree the notions of a savior and deliverer, and the
necessity of his mission for procuring the salvation of man.&rdquo; St.
Hilaire says: &ldquo;He [Buddha] requires humility, disregard of
worldly wealth, patience and resignation in adversity, love to enemies
... non-resistance to evil, confession of sins and conversion.&rdquo;
The bishop of Ramatha says: &ldquo;There are many moral precepts
equally commanded and enforced in common by both creeds. It will not be
rash to assert that most of the moral truths prescribed in the gospel
are to be met with in the Buddhistic scriptures.&rdquo; Writing of
Buddhism, Mrs. Spier, in her &ldquo;Life in Ancient India,&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;Before God planted Christianity upon earth, he took a branch
from the luxuriant tree, and threw it down to India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The external forms of Christianity, especially of Catholic
Christianity, are modeled in a large degree after those of Buddhism. Of
Northern Buddhism (Lamaism) the &ldquo;Encyclopedia Britannica&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;Lamaism, with its shaven priests, its bells and rosaries,
its images and holy water, its popes and bishops, its abbots and monks
of many grades, its processions and feast days, its confessional and
purgatory, and its worship of the double Virgin, so strongly resembles
Romanism that the first Catholic missionaries thought it must be an
imitation by the devil of the religion <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb510" href="#pb510" name="pb510">510</a>]</span>of Christ.&rdquo; The
central object in every Buddhist temple is an image of Buddha. The
central object in every Catholic church is an image of Christ. Holy
relics and the veneration of saints are prominent in both.</p>
<p>Buddha commanded his disciples to preach his gospel to all men.
Christ commanded his disciples to do the same. In obedience to these
commands the world was filled with missionaries, and largely as the
result of this the adherents of these religious systems outnumber those
of all others combined. Christian tradition says that Thomas visited
India. Some believe that it was in this way that the early Christians
became acquainted with the history and teachings of Krishna and Buddha.
This may be true, but so far as the Buddhistic element in Christianity
is concerned it is quite as reasonable to suppose that Buddhist
missionaries had previously carried their religion to Alexandria and
Rome, where the molders of the Christian creed obtained their knowledge
of it. &ldquo;That remarkable missionary movement, beginning 300 B.
C.,&rdquo; says Max Muller, &ldquo;sent forth a succession of devoted
men who spent their lives in spreading the faith of Buddha over all
parts of Asia.&rdquo; Harden-Hickey says: &ldquo;It is not doubted at
the present day that Indian religious ideas, and indeed more
particularly those of Buddhism, reached and were even propagated as far
as Egypt, Asia Minor, and Palestine, long before the Christian
era.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb511" href="#pb511" name=
"pb511">511</a>]</span></p>
<p>Connected with the triumphs of these religious faiths there is a
historical analogy deserving mention. Three centuries after the time of
Buddha, Asoka the Great, emperor of India, became a convert to the
Buddhist faith, made it the state religion of the empire, and did more
than any other man to secure its supremacy in the East. Three centuries
after Christ, Constantine the Great, emperor of Rome, became a convert
to the Christian faith, made it the state religion of his empire, and
won for it the supremacy of the West.</p>
<p>Remuset says: &ldquo;Buddhism has been called the Christianity of
the East.&rdquo; It would be more appropriate to call Christianity the
Buddhism of the West. Buddha, and not Christ, was &ldquo;The Light of
Asia.&rdquo; At this torch Christians lighted their taper and called it
&ldquo;The Light of the World.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Confucius.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This great Chinese sage and religious founder was born
551 B. C. His followers believed him to be divine. His birth was
attended by prodigies. Magi and angels visited him, while celestial
music filled the air. His disciples invented a genealogy for him,
giving him a princely descent from Hoang-ti, a Chinese monarch, just as
the Christian Evangelists at a later period invented genealogies for
Christ, giving him a princely pedigree from David. Concerning his
deification the &ldquo;International Encyclopedia&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;By the irony of fate he was deified after his death, and,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb512" href="#pb512" name=
"pb512">512</a>]</span>like Buddha, Confucius, who had little belief in
the supernatural, became a divinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Boulger states, &ldquo;His name and his teachings were
perpetuated by a band of devoted disciples, and the book which
contained the moral and philosophical axioms of Confucius passed into
the classical literature of the country and stood in the place of a
Bible for the Chinese&rdquo; (History of China, p. 16).</p>
<p>Of all the great religious systems which have appeared since the
dawn of history Buddhism and Confucianism, as originally presented,
from a rational standpoint, stand pre-eminent. In both the supernatural
is almost entirely absent. Both are godless religions, and both have
been, for the most part, bloodless religions. The adherents of both
have practiced in the highest degree what the adherents of their great
rival have only professed: &ldquo;On earth peace, good will toward
men.&rdquo; Both systems, like primitive Christianity, have been
corrupted; but the system of Confucius has suffered less than that of
Buddha. The religious, or rather ethical, system taught by Confucius,
is the religion of the intellectual aristocracy of China, and, to a
great extent, the religion of the most enlightened everywhere.</p>
<p>Christian scholars have been surprised to find in the writings of
Confucius some of the best teachings attributed to Christ. The Golden
Rule has been ascribed to the Christian founder. And yet this rule is
the very essence of Confucianism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb513"
href="#pb513" name="pb513">513</a>]</span>and was borrowed from it. In
a presentation of the teachings of the Chinese sage, Rev. James Legge
of Oxford University, the highest European authority on China and
Confucius, says: &ldquo;Foremost among these we must rank his distinct
enunciation of the Golden Rule, deduced by him from his study of
man&rsquo;s mental condition. Several times he gave that rule in
express words: &lsquo;What you do not like when done to yourself do not
to others.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To retain for Christ a portion of the credit due Confucius,
Christians assert that the Chinese moralist merely taught the negative
form of this rule, the abstaining from doing to others what we dislike
to have them do to us, while Christ taught the positive form, the doing
to others what we desire them to do to us. Regarding this Mr. Legge
says: &ldquo;It has been said that he only gave the rule in a negative
form; but he understood it also in its positive and most comprehensive
form, and deplored on one occasion at least, that he had not himself
always attained to taking the initiative in doing to others as he would
have them do to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another analogy may be noticed. The religion of Confucius enjoins
absolute obedience to national rulers. This, too, is a prominent tenet
of the Christian religion. As the result of this, Confucianism became
and has remained the state religion of China, while Christianity became
and has remained the state religion of Europe. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Laou-tsze.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Laou-tsze, the other great religious founder of China,
was born 604 B. C. His entry into the world and his exit from it were
attended by miracles. Like Christ he was miraculously conceived; like
Christ he ascended bodily into heaven. He was believed to be an
incarnation of an astral god.</p>
<p>His gospel, the &ldquo;Tao Teh King,&rdquo; was written by him.
&ldquo;Tao&rdquo; means &ldquo;the way.&rdquo; Christ was called
&ldquo;the Way.&rdquo; Man, according to this gospel, is both a
material and a spiritual being. By the renunciation of riches and
worldly enjoyments the soul attains to immortality. The most divine of
mortals are, like Enoch and Elijah, translated to heaven without
suffering death. Laou-tsze taught that men to be righteous must become
&ldquo;as little children.&rdquo; Christ said: &ldquo;Except ye be
converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2018:3">Matt.
xviii<span class="corr" id="xd21e14100" title="Source: .">,</span>
3</a>).</p>
<p>The more ignorant followers of Laou-tsze, like the more ignorant
followers of Christ, believe that many diseases are caused by evil
spirits, and their priests, like Christ, practice exorcism to expel
them. Like the Catholics, they have monasteries and convents.</p>
<p>Of Laou-tsze&rsquo;s writings Prof. Montuci, the Italian
philologist, says: &ldquo;Many things about a triune God are so clearly
expressed that no one who has read this book can doubt that the mystery
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb515" href="#pb515" name=
"pb515">515</a>]</span>of the Holy Trinity was revealed to the Chinese
five centuries before the coming of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is one element in Christianity which was not borrowed from
Paganism&mdash;religious intolerance. Referring to Buddhism,
Confucianism, and Taouism, a writer on China says: &ldquo;Between the
followers of the three national religions there is not only a total
absence of persecution and bitter feeling, but a very great
indifference as to which of them a man may belong.... Among the politer
classes, when strangers meet, the question is asked: &lsquo;To what
sublime religion do you belong?&rsquo; and each one pronounces a
eulogium, not on his own religion, but on that professed by the others,
and concludes with the oft-repeated formula: &lsquo;Religions are many;
reason is one; we are all brothers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Zoroaster.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Persian prophet Zoroaster lived and wrote at least
1200 years before the Christian era. From his teachings some of the
most important doctrines of Christianity, as well as of Judaism, were
derived.</p>
<p>According to the Persian theology the universe is ruled by two great
powers, Ormuzd (God) and Ahrimanes (Satan). The one represents light,
the other darkness; the one is good, the other evil. Between these two
powers there is perpetual war. The center of battle is man, each
striving for his soul. God created man with a free will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb516" href="#pb516" name="pb516">516</a>]</span>to
choose between good and evil. Those who choose the good are rewarded
with everlasting life in heaven; those who choose the evil are punished
with endless misery in hell; while those in whom the good and evil are
balanced pass into an intermediate state (purgatory), to remain until
the last judgment.</p>
<p>To save mankind God sent a savior in the person of Zoroaster with a
divine revelation, the &ldquo;Zend Avesta.&rdquo; Like Christ,
Zoroaster was of supernatural origin and endowed with superhuman
powers. Like Christ, he believed that Satan would be dethroned and cast
into hell; like Christ he believed that the end of the world and the
kingdom of God were at hand; like Christ, he taught his followers to
worship God; like Christ he declared that God heard and answered
prayer; like Christ he was tempted by Satan; like Christ he performed
miracles; like Christ he was slain by those whom he had come to
save.</p>
<p>McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cyclopedia&rdquo; gives a
summary of the principal doctrines of Zoroaster among which are the
following:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The principal duty of man in this
life is to obey the word and commandments of God.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Those who obey the word of God
will be free from all defects and immortal.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God exercises his rule in the
world through the works prompted by the Divine Spirit, who is working
in man and nature. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb517" href="#pb517"
name="pb517">517</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Men should pray to God and worship
him. He hears the prayers of the good.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All men live solely through the
bounty of God.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The soul of the pure will
hereafter enjoy everlasting life; that of the wicked will have to
undergo everlasting punishment&rdquo; (Art. Zoroaster).</p>
<p>Devils and angels are of Persian origin. Dr. Kalisch, the eminent
Jewish scholar, says: &ldquo;When the Jews, ever open to foreign
influence in matters of faith, lived under Persian rule, they imbibed,
among many other religious views of their masters, their doctrines of
angels and spirits, which, in the region of the Euphrates and Tigris,
were most luxuriantly developed&rdquo; (Leviticus, part II, p. 287).
&ldquo;The belief in spirits and demons was not a concession made by
educated men to the prejudices of the masses, but a concession which
all&mdash;the educated as well as the uneducated&mdash;made to Pagan
polytheism&rdquo; (Ibid).</p>
<p>Strauss says: &ldquo;It is in the Maccabean Daniel and in the
Apocryphal Tobit that this doctrine of angels, in the most precise
form, first appears; and it is evidently a product of the influence of
the Zend religion of the Persian on the Jewish mind. We have the
testimony of the Jews themselves that they brought the names of the
angels with them from Babylon&rdquo; (<span lang="de">Leben
Jesu</span>, p. 78).</p>
<p>Baptism, communion, and even confirmation, are rites that were
performed in Persia a thousand years before the advent of Christ. Dr.
Hyde, in his &ldquo;Religion of the Ancient Persians,&rdquo; says:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb518" href="#pb518" name=
"pb518">518</a>]</span>&ldquo;They do not use circumcision for their
children, but only baptism or washing for the inward purification of
the soul.... After such washing, or baptism, the priest imposes on the
child the name given by his parents. Afterwards, in the fifteenth year
of his age, when he begins to put on the tunic, the sudra, and the
girdle, that he may enter upon religion, and is engaged in the articles
of belief, the priest bestows upon him confirmation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following, from the &ldquo;Britannica,&rdquo; was written by
England&rsquo;s leading authority on Zoroaster, Professor Gildner:
&ldquo;Like John the Baptist and the Apostles of Jesus, Zoroaster also
believed that the fullness of time was near, that the kingdom of heaven
was at hand. Through the whole of the Gathas (the Psalms of Zoroaster)
runs the pious hope that the end of the present world is not far off.
He himself hopes along with his followers to live to see the decisive
turn of things, the dawn of the new and better aeon. Ormuzd will summon
together all his powers for a final struggle and break the power of
evil forever; by his help the faithful will achieve the victory over
their detested enemies, the daeva worshipers, and render them
powerless. Thereupon Ormuzd will hold a judicium universale upon all
mankind and judge strictly according to justice, punish the wicked, and
assign to the good the hoped-for reward. Satan will be cast, along with
all those who have been delivered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb519"
href="#pb519" name="pb519">519</a>]</span>over to him to suffer the
pains of hell, into the abyss, where he will thenceforward lie
powerless. Forthwith begins the one undivided kingdom of God in heaven
and on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Substitute &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; for &ldquo;Zoroaster,&rdquo;
&ldquo;God&rdquo; for &ldquo;Ormuzd,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gospels&rdquo;
for &ldquo;Gathas,&rdquo; in the above, and we have almost an exact
exposition of the teachings of Christ. And Zoroaster taught at least
1200 years before Christ taught, and wrote his &ldquo;Gathas&rdquo;
more than 1300 years before the Gospels were written. The writings of
Zoroaster were the principal source of the most important theological
doctrines ascribed to Christ, as the Buddhistic writings were of his
ethical teachings.</p>

<h3 class="main">Mithra.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This god was the offspring of the Sun, and, next to
Ormuzd and Ahrimanes, held the highest rank among the gods of ancient
Persia. He was represented as a beautiful youth. He is the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e14161" title="Source: Meditator">Mediator</span>. From
the Rev. J. W. Lake I quote the following: &ldquo;Mithras is spiritual
light contending with spiritual darkness, and through his labors the
kingdom of darkness shall be lit with heaven&rsquo;s own light; the
Eternal will receive all things back into his favor, the world will be
redeemed to God. The impure are to be purified, and the evil made good,
through the mediation of Mithras, the reconciler of Ormuzd and Ahriman.
Mithras is the Good, his name is Love. In relation to the Eternal he is
the source of grace, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb520" href=
"#pb520" name="pb520">520</a>]</span>relation to man he is the
life-giver and mediator&rdquo; (Plato, Philo, and Paul, p. 15).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;International Encyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Mithras
seems to have owed his prominence to the belief that he was the source
of life, and could also redeem the souls of the dead into the better
world.... The ceremonies included a sort of baptism to remove sins,
anointing, and a sacred meal of bread and water, while a consecrated
wine, believed to possess wonderful power, played a prominent
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning Mithra &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclopedia&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;The most important of his many festivals was his birthday,
celebrated on the 25th of December, the day subsequently
fixed&mdash;against all evidence&mdash;as the birthday of Christ. The
worship of Mithras early found its way into Rome, and the mysteries of
Mithras, which fell in the spring equinox, were famous even among the
many Roman festivals. The ceremonies observed in the initiation to
these mysteries&mdash;symbolical of the struggle between Ahriman and
Ormuzd (the Good and the Evil)&mdash;were of the most extraordinary and
to a certain degree even dangerous character. Baptism and the partaking
of a mystical liquid, consisting of flour and water, to be drunk with
the utterance of sacred formulas, were among the inauguration
acts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the catacombs at Rome was preserved a relic of the old Mithraic
worship. It was a picture of the infant Mithra seated in the lap of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb521" href="#pb521" name=
"pb521">521</a>]</span>virgin mother, while on their knees before him
were Persian Magi adoring him and offering gifts.</p>
<p>Prof. Franz Cumont, of the University of Ghent, writes as follows
concerning the religion of Mithra and the religion of Christ:
&ldquo;The sectaries of the Persian god, like the Christians&rsquo;,
purified themselves by baptism, received by a species of confirmation
the power necessary to combat the spirit of evil; and expected from a
Lord&rsquo;s supper salvation of body and soul. Like the latter, they
also held Sunday sacred, and celebrated the birth of the Sun on the
25th of December.... They both preached a categorical system of ethics,
regarded asceticism as meritorious and counted among their principal
virtues abstinence and continence, renunciation and self-control. Their
conceptions of the world and of the destiny of man were similar. They
both admitted the existence of a Heaven inhabited by beatified ones,
situate in the upper regions, and of a Hell, peopled by demons, situate
in the bowels of the earth. They both placed a flood at the beginning
of history; they both assigned as the source of their condition, a
primitive revelation; they both, finally, believed in the immortality
of the soul, in a last judgment, and in a resurrection of the dead,
consequent upon a final conflagration of the universe&rdquo; (The
Mysteries of Mithras, pp. 190, 191).</p>
<p>The Rev. Charles Biggs, D.D., says: &ldquo;The disciples
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb522" href="#pb522" name=
"pb522">522</a>]</span>of Mithra formed an organized church, with a
developed hierarchy. They possessed the ideas of Mediation, Atonement,
and a Savior, who is human and yet divine, and not only the idea, but a
doctrine of the future life. They had a Eucharist, and a Baptism, and
other curious analogies might be pointed out between their system and
the church of Christ&rdquo; (The Christian Platonists, p. 240).</p>
<p>I quote again from McClintock and Strong: &ldquo;In modern times
Christian writers have been induced to look favorably upon the
assertion that some of our ecclesiastical usages (e. g., the
institution of the Christmas festival) originated in the cultus of
Mithraism. Some writers who refuse to accept the Christian religion as
of supernatural origin, have even gone so far as to institute a close
comparison with the founder of Christianity; and Dupuis and others,
going even beyond this, have not hesitated to pronounce the Gospel
simply a branch of Mithraism&rdquo; (Art. Mithra).</p>
<p>The Christian Father Manes, founder of the heretical sect known as
Manicheans, believed that Christ and Mithra were one. His teaching,
according to Mosheim, was as follows: &ldquo;Christ is that glorious
intelligence which the Persians called Mithras.... His residence is in
the sun&rdquo; (Ecclesiastical History, 3rd century, Part 2, ch.
5).</p>
<p>The Mithraic worship at one time covered a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb523" href="#pb523" name=
"pb523">523</a>]</span>large portion of the ancient world. It
flourished as late as the second century, but finally went down before
its young and invincible rival which appropriated, to a great extent,
its doctrines, rites and customs.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sosiosh.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Messianic idea, as we have seen, came from Persia.
The expected Messiah of the Jews and the Christ of Christians are of
Persian origin. Sosiosh, the Messiah of the Persians, is the son of
Zoroaster, &ldquo;begotten in a supernatural way.&rdquo; He constitutes
a part of the Persian Trinity. He exists, as yet, only in a spiritual
form. His incarnation and advent on earth are yet to be. When he comes
he will bring with him a new revelation. He will awaken the dead and
preside at the last judgment. Zoroaster, it is claimed, predicted his
coming, declaring that he would be born of a virgin, and that a star
would indicate the place of his birth. &ldquo;As soon,
therefore,&rdquo; said Zoroaster, &ldquo;as you shall behold the star,
follow it whithersoever it shall lead you and adore that mysterious
child, offering your gifts to him with profound humility.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them
till it came and stood over where the young child was.... And when they
were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his
mother, and fell down, and worshiped him; and when they had opened

<h3 class="main">Adonis.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From Babylonia, including Accadia, Chaldea, and
Assyria, much of Christianity has come. Christ himself was descended
from the Babylonian pantheon; his father, Jehovah, being originally a
Babylonian god. Adonis, Tammouz, Tam-zi, or Du-zi, as he was variously
called, was a Babylonian deity whose worship gradually spread over
Syria, Phoenicia and Greece. He was one of the most ancient of the sons
of gods. His origin may be traced to that fertile, and perhaps
earliest, source of gods and religions, Accadia. His worship was a
combination of sun worship and sex worship. He was the god of light,
and life, and love. Associated with his worship in Babylonia and Syria
was the worship of Istar; and in Phoenicia and Greece the worship of
Venus.</p>
<p>Under the name of Tammouz, Adonis was worshiped by the Jews. At the
very gates of the temple, Ezekiel tells us, &ldquo;There sat women
weeping for Tammouz&rdquo; (&ldquo;Adonis&rdquo; in Catholic ver.)
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ez%208:14">viii,
14</a>). In the Bible he is frequently referred to as &ldquo;the only
son.&rdquo; One of the months of the Hebrew calendar was named in honor
of him. The abstaining from the use of pork by the Jews had its origin
in the legend of the slaying of Adonis by the wild boar. And the eating
of fish on Friday by Christians is doubtless due to the fact that
Friday was consecrated to Venus by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb525"
href="#pb525" name="pb525">525</a>]</span>her Asiatic worshipers and
fish was eaten in her honor.</p>
<p>In a citation of Babylonian and Biblical analogies, the
&ldquo;Encyclopedia Britannica&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The resemblance is
still more striking when we examine the Babylonian mythology. The
sacred tree of Babylonia, with its guardian cherubs&mdash;a word, by
the way, which seems of Accadian origin&mdash;as well as the flaming
sword or thunderbolt of fifty points and seven heads, recall Biblical
analogies, while the Noachian deluge differs but slightly from the
Chaldean one. Indeed, the Jehovistic version of the flood story in
Genesis agrees not only in details, but even in phraseology with that
which forms the eleventh lay of the great Babylonian epic. The hero of
the latter is Tam-zi or Tammuz, &lsquo;the sun of life,&rsquo; the son
of Ubaratutu, &lsquo;the glow of sunset,&rsquo; and denotes the
revivifying luminary of day, who sails upon his &lsquo;ark&rsquo;
behind the clouds of winter to reappear when the rainy season is past.
He is called Sisuthrus by Berosus, that is, Susru &lsquo;the
founder,&rsquo; a synonym of Na &lsquo;the sky.&rsquo; The mountain on
which his ark rested was placed in Nisir, southwest of Lake Urumiyeh.
Its peak, whereon the first altar was built after the deluge, was the
legendary model after which the zigurats or towers of the Babylonian
temples were erected. Besides the account of the flood, fragments have
been met with of stories resembling those of the tower of Babel or
Babylon, of the creation, of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb526"
href="#pb526" name="pb526">526</a>]</span>fall, and of the sacrifice of
Isaac&mdash;the latter, by the way, forming the first lay of the great
epic. The sixth lay we possess in full. It describes the descent of
Istar into Hades in pursuit of her dead husband Du-zi, &lsquo;the
off-spring,&rsquo; the Babylonian Adonis. Du-zi is but another form of
Tam-zi and denotes the sun when obscured by night and
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the two lays of this Babylonian or Assyrian epic which
pertain to Adonis, Dr. Soury says: &ldquo;The two important episodes of
this epic hitherto discovered, &lsquo;The Deluge,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Descent of Istar into Hell,&rsquo; yield the best commentary on the
Biblical stories of the deluge and hell (sheol). We have henceforth the
epigraphic proof, confirming the valuable testimony of Berosus, that
these legends&mdash;like those of the creation, of the Tower of Babel,
etc.&mdash;did not originate in Palestine, but were carried thither by
the Hebrews with the civilization and worship of the people of the
valley of the Tigris and Euphrates, amid whom they had sojourned for
centuries.... The Babylonian deluge is also a chastisement from the
deity; it is the consequence of man&rsquo;s corruption (Assyrian poem,
line 22). The details of the building of the Babylonian ark (line 24),
into which are introduced the various pairs of male and female animals
(line 80), of the shutting of the doors of the ark (line 89), of the
duration, increase and decrease of the flood (lines 123&ndash;129), of
the sending out of a dove, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb527" href=
"#pb527" name="pb527">527</a>]</span>a swallow and a raven (lines
140&ndash;144), etc., leave no doubt as to the origin of the legend of
Genesis&rdquo; (Religion of Israel, p. 10).</p>
<p>The noted Assyriologist, George Smith, of the British Museum, who
discovered the tablets containing these fragments of the Babylonian
epic, says that the original text of these legends cannot be later than
the 17th century B. C., and may be much earlier, thus antedating the
oldest books of the Bible nearly 1,000 years. From these and other
Babylonian and Persian legends the most of the Old Testament legends
were borrowed. This fact disproves the existence of the orthodox
Christ. If the accounts of the creation, the fall of man, and the
Noachian deluge, as given in the Bible, are not authentic, but merely
borrowed fables, then there remains no foundation for an atoning
Savior.</p>
<p>Describing the worship of Adonis, &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s
Encyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;His festivals were partly the
expressions of joy, partly of mourning. In the latter the women gave
themselves up to the most unmitigated grief over the &lsquo;lost
Adonis.&rsquo;... This period was followed by a succession of festive
and joyful days, in honor of the resurrection of Adonis.&rdquo; These
festivals correspond to the Good Friday and Easter of Christians,
commemorating the death and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>The most ardent worshipers of Adonis were women. No other character,
real or imaginary, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb528" href="#pb528"
name="pb528">528</a>]</span>has so stirred the passions and the
emotions of woman as this beautiful young lover of Venus. His tragic
death bathed with immortal sadness the hearts of his devotees, and from
the remotest ages down to a very late period moved to tears the
daughters of men who adored him. Writing of Bethlehem at the close of
the fourth century, St. Jerome says: &ldquo;The lover of Venus is
mourned in the grotto where Christ wailed as an infant.&rdquo; Along
with the &ldquo;Holy Sepulchre&rdquo; of Christ, there still exists the
&ldquo;Tomb of Adonis,&rdquo; where &ldquo;the women of the ancient
mysteries, in the intoxication of a voluptuous grief, came to cover
with tears and kisses the cenotaph of the beautiful youth.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Even at the present time,&rdquo; says Renan, &ldquo;the Syrian
hymns sung in honor of the Virgin are a kind of tearful sigh, a strange
sob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moved by the same passions and the same emotions that thrilled the
hearts of the female worshipers of Adonis, it is the women of
Christendom, who, more than any other cause, keep alive the memory and
the religion of Christ. Thus writes a Carmelite nun describing the
passionate adoration of her Christian sisters:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;One day they have raised their
eyes to an adorable face. A horrible diadem of interlaced branches
binds the august forehead; rubies of blood roll slowly upon the livid
pallor of the cheeks; the mouth has forgotten how to smile. It is a man
of sorrows. They have looked upon him and found him more beautiful,
more noble, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb529" href="#pb529" name=
"pb529">529</a>]</span>more loyal than any spouse. They have felt a
stronger heart-beat in his divine breast; they have understood that
death no more dare touch his emaciated figure, and that his conjugal
fidelity is eternal.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Captivated, ravished, enamoured,
enraptured, they have loved him. Rendered insensible by love, they have
trampled cruelly upon the broken hearts of fathers and desolate
mothers; they have listened, tearless, to the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e14233" title="Source: woful">woeful</span> beseechings of those
who desire them for companions; they have followed to Carmel the unique
lover, the immortal husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ancient adoration of Adonis survives in this modern adoration of
Jesus. We see here the same strange commingling of superstition and
fanaticism, of love and sorrow, of ecstasy and agony, of chastity and
lust. The religion is the same; the worship is the same. The divine
lovers only have been changed. The beautiful Pagan has been supplanted
by the Ideal Man.</p>
<p>Writing of the Protestant women of his day, Thomas Jefferson says:
&ldquo;In our Richmond there is much fanaticism, but chiefly among the
women<span class="corr" id="xd21e14241" title="Not in source">.</span>
They have their night meetings and praying parties, where, attended by
their priests, ... they pour forth their love to Jesus in terms as
amatory and carnal as their modesty would permit to a mere earthly
lover&rdquo; (Jefferson&rsquo;s Works, Vol. IV, p. 358,
Randolph&rsquo;s ed.). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb530" href=

<p class="first">One of the most ancient and one of the most renowned
of all the gods was Osiris, the Savior of Egypt. He was the son of Seb
(earth) and Nu (heaven). He appears in the hieroglyphics of Egypt as
early as 3427 B. C. Two thousand years before Christ his worship was
universal in Egypt, and during the succeeding centuries spread over
much of Asia and Europe, including Greece and Rome. Its priests looked
confidently forward to the time when all men would be brought to
Osiris, just as Christian priests today look forward to the time when
all men will be brought to Christ.</p>
<p>Osiris was slain by Typhon (Satan), but rose again and became the
ruler of the dead. He presides at the judgment of the departed where
the good are rewarded with everlasting life, and the wicked are
destroyed. The Osirian Bible is called the &ldquo;Book of the
Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christians are indebted to this religion largely for their views
concerning immortality and a bodily resurrection. They believe that
through the death and resurrection of Christ they have inherited
eternal life, that when their earthly career is ended they will live
again in him. Regarding the Egyptians&rsquo; belief, the
&ldquo;International Encyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Just as Osiris
died and lived again, so the spiritual personality of the deceased
lived again and was merged in Osiris.&rdquo; Of Osiris the Rev. Dr.
Charles Gillett, of Union Theological Seminary, says: &ldquo;The belief
in him and in the immortality <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb531"
href="#pb531" name="pb531">531</a>]</span>which he symbolized was the
deepest in Egyptian religious thought.&rdquo; Sir John Gardner
Wilkinson, one of the most eminent Egyptologists, says: &ldquo;The
peculiar character of Osiris, his coming upon earth for the benefit of
mankind, with the titles of &lsquo;Manifester of Good&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Revealer of Truth&rsquo;; his being put to death by the malice
of the Evil One; his burial and resurrection, and his becoming the
judge of the dead, are the most interesting features of the Egyptian
religion.&rdquo; John Stuart Glennie, another English writer, notes the
following analogies between the religion of Osiris and the religion of
Christ: &ldquo;In ancient Osirianism, as in modern Christianism, we
find the worship of a divine mother and child. In ancient Osirianism as
in modern Christianism, there is a doctrine of atonement. In ancient
Osirianism, as in modern Christianism, we find the vision of a last
judgment, and resurrection of the body. And finally, in ancient
Osirianism, as in modern Christianism, the sanctions of morality are a
lake of fire and torturing demons on the one hand, and on the other,
eternal life in the presence of God&rdquo; (Christ and Osiris, p.
14).</p>
<p>Referring to Osiris, McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;He was regarded as the
personification of moral good. He is related to have been on earth
instructing mankind in useful arts; to have been slain by his adversary
Typhon by whom he was cut in pieces; to have been bewailed by his wife
and sister Isis; to have been embalmed; to have risen again, and to
have become the judge of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb532" href=
"#pb532" name="pb532">532</a>]</span>the dead, among whom the righteous
were called by his name and received his form&mdash;a wonderful
fore-feeling of the Gospel narrative&rdquo; (Art. Egypt).</p>
<p>Isis, the sister and wife of Osiris, was the greatest of female
divinities. Her worship was coexistent and coextensive with that of her
divine brother and husband. We have the following picture of her in the
Apocalypse: &ldquo;And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman
clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
crown of twelve stars&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2012:1">Revelation
xii, 1</a>). The worship of Isis existed in Rome and Alexandria during
the formative period of Christianity and Christians borrowed much from
it.</p>

<h3 class="main">Horus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This popular Egyptian god was the son of Osiris and
Isis. Osiris and Horus were both solar deities; Osiris was the setting
sun, Horus the rising sun. Christ, it is claimed, existed before his
incarnation; and Horus, it was claimed, existed even before the
incarnation of his father. Christ when an infant was carried into Egypt
to escape the wrath of Herod; Horus when an infant was carried out of
Egypt to escape the wrath of Typhon. To avenge the death of his father
he afterward vanquished Typhon. He was the last of the gods who reigned
in Egypt. Festivals and movable feasts similar to those celebrated in
honor of Christ were held in his honor.</p>
<p>In India and Egypt, ages before the appearance of Christianity, the
doctrine of the Trinity prevailed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb533"
href="#pb533" name="pb533">533</a>]</span>Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva
constituted the principal trinity of India, while the most important
Trinity of Egypt was Osiris, Isis, and Horus. Even the Christian
doctrine of a Trinity in Unity, an absurdity which Christianity alone
is supposed to have taught, was an Egyptian doctrine. Samuel Sharp, in
his &ldquo;Egyptian Mythology&rdquo; (p. 14), says: &ldquo;We have a
hieroglyphical inscription in the British Museum as early as the reign
of Sevechus of the eighth century before the Christian era, showing
that the doctrine of Trinity in Unity already formed part of their
religion and that * * * the three gods only made one person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Draper says: &ldquo;For thirty centuries the Egyptians had been
familiar with the conception of a triune God. There was hardly a city
of any note without its particular triads. Here it was Amum, Maut, and
Khonso; there Osiris, Isis, and Horus&rdquo; (Intellectual Development,
Vol. I, p. 191).</p>
<p>Dr. Inman affirms the Egyptian origin of the Christian trinity:
&ldquo;The Christian trinity is of Egyptian origin, and is as surely a
Pagan doctrine as the belief in heaven and hell, the existence of a
devil, of archangels, angels, spirits and saints, martyrs and virgins,
intercessors in heaven, gods and demigods, and other forms of faith
which deface the greater part of modern religions&rdquo; (Ancient Pagan
and Modern Christian Symbolism, p. 13).</p>
<p>There are two myths connected with Horus analogous to stories found
in the Old Testament, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb534" href=
"#pb534" name="pb534">534</a>]</span>which were old when these stories
were written. The hiding of Horus in a marsh by his mother undoubtedly
suggested the myth of the hiding of Moses in a marsh by his mother.
When Horus died Isis implored Ra, the sun, to restore him to life. Ra
stopped his ship in mid-heaven and sent down Thoth, the moon, to bring
him back to life. The stopping of the sun and moon by Isis recalls the
myth of the stopping of the sun and moon by Joshua.</p>
<p>The deification and worship of the Virgin had its origin in the
worship of Isis, and the adoration of the Virgin and Child is but the
adoration of Isis and Horus transferred to Mary and Jesus. Describing
the Paganization of Christianity Dr. Draper says: &ldquo;Views of the
Trinity, in accordance with Egyptian tradition, were established. Not
only was the adoration of Isis under a new name restored, but even her
image standing on the crescent moon reappeared. The well-known effigy
of that goddess, with the infant Horus in her arms, has descended to
our days in the beautiful artistic creations of the Madonna and
Child&rdquo; (Conflict, p. 48).</p>
<p>That the Virgin Mary of the Roman Catholic church was borrowed from
Egypt is shown by the fact that in the earlier representations of her,
she was, like Isis, veiled. Concerning this Draper, in his
&ldquo;Intellectual Development&rdquo; (Vol. I, p. 361), says:
&ldquo;Of the Virgin Mary, destined in later times to furnish so many
beautiful types of female loveliness, the earliest representations are
veiled. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb535" href="#pb535" name=
"pb535">535</a>]</span>Egyptian sculptors had thus depicted Isis; the
first form of the Virgin and Child was the counterpart of Isis and
Horus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. G. W. Brown, author of &ldquo;Researches in Oriental
History,&rdquo; writes: &ldquo;Mural illustrations of this mother and
child are not confined to Egypt, but are scattered all over Asia Minor,
and are numerous in Italy, while many temples and shrines are yet found
which were erected to their memory. <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%202:15">Matthew ii,
15</a>, claims to be a quotation from one of the prophets:
&lsquo;<i>Out of Egypt have I called my son.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing of the ancient Gnostics, C. W. King, a noted English author,
says: &ldquo;To this period belongs a beautiful sard in my collection,
representing Serapis, * * * whilst before him stands Isis, holding in
one hand the sistrum, in the other a wheatsheaf, with the legend:
&lsquo;Immaculate is our lady Isis,&rsquo; the very term applied
afterwards to that personage who succeeded to her form, her symbols,
rites, and ceremonies&rdquo; (Gnostics and Their Remains, p. 71).</p>
<p>Regarding the transference of the attributes of Isis to Mary,
Newton, in his &ldquo;Assyrian Grove and Other Emblems,&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;When Mary, the mother of Jesus, took the place in Christendom of
&lsquo;the great goddess,&rsquo; the dogmas which propounded her
immaculate conception and perpetual virginity followed as a matter of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The &lsquo;Black
Virgins,&rsquo;&rdquo; says King, &ldquo;so highly reverenced in
certain French cathedrals during the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb536" href="#pb536" name="pb536">536</a>]</span>middle ages, proved,
when critically examined, basalt figures of Isis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Besant believes that Christianity was derived chiefly from
Egypt: &ldquo;It grew out of Egypt; its gospels came from thence
[Alexandria]; its ceremonies were learned there; its Virgin is Isis;
its Christ Osiris and Horus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the antiquity of Egypt&rsquo;s religion, and the mutability of
the gods, that brilliant young Englishman, Winwood Reade, thus writes:
&ldquo;Buried cities are beneath our feet; the ground on which we tread
is the pavement of a tomb. See the pyramids towering to the sky, with
men, like insects, crawling round their base; and the Sphinx, couched
in vast repose, with a ruined temple between its paws. Since those
great monuments were raised the very heavens have been changed. When
the architects of Egypt began their work, there was another polar star
in the northern sky, and the southern cross shone upon the Baltic
shores. How glorious are the memories of those ancient men, whose names
are forgotten, for they lived and labored in the distant and unwritten
past. Too great to be known, they sit on the height of centuries and
look down on fame. * * * The men are dead, and the gods are dead.
Naught but their memories remain. Where now is Osiris, who came down
upon earth out of love for man, who was killed by the malice of the
evil one, who rose again from the grave and became the judge of the
dead? Where now is Isis the mother, with the child Horus in her lap?
They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb537" href="#pb537" name=
"pb537">537</a>]</span>are dead; they are gone to the land of the
shades. To-morrow, Jehovah, you and your son shall be with
them.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Zeus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Zeus, Jove, or Jupiter, as he is variously called, was
the greatest of the sons of gods and held the highest place in the
pantheons of Greece and Rome. He was the son of the god Kronos and the
goddess Rhea.</p>
<p>The gods of Greece, while mostly pure myths, were yet intensely
human. In these gods human vices sank to the lowest depths and human
virtues rose to the loftiest heights. Zeus was one of the most puerile,
one of the most sublime, one of the most depraved and one of the most
beneficent of deities. In the words of Andrew Lang, &ldquo;He is the
sum of the religious thought of Hellas, found in the numberless ages
between savagery and complete civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeus, like Christ, assumed the form of man. The life of the infant
Pagan deity, like that of the infant Christian deity, was imperiled.
Kronos tried to destroy him, but he was secreted in a cave and saved.
There was a widely accepted tradition among primitive Christians,
before the myth of the shepherd&rsquo;s manger gained credence, that
Christ was cradled in a cave. Concerning these myths, Strauss says:
&ldquo;The myths of the ancient world more generally ascribed divine
apparitions to countrymen and shepherds; the sons of the gods, and of
great men were frequently brought up <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb538" href="#pb538" name="pb538">538</a>]</span>among shepherds. In
the same spirit of the ancient legend is the apocryphal invention that
Jesus was born in a cave, and we are at once reminded of the cave of
Jupiter (Zeus) and the other gods&rdquo; (<span lang="de">Leben
Jesu</span>, p. 154).</p>
<p>This god, like Jehovah, became the ruler of heaven and earth. Like
Jehovah he became dissatisfied with the human race, and with the aid of
Pandora, who brought death into the world, tried to destroy it that he
might create a new race.</p>
<p>Seneca refers to Zeus as &ldquo;the guardian and ruler of the
universe, the soul and spirit, the lord and master of this mundane
sphere * * * from whom all things proceed, by whose spirit we
live.&rdquo; Lecky says: &ldquo;The language in which the first Greek
dramatists asserted the supreme authority and universal providence of
Zeus was so emphatic that the Christian fathers commonly attributed it
either to direct inspiration or to a knowledge of the Jewish
writings&rdquo; (European Morals, Vol. I, p. 161).</p>
<p>One of the daughters of Zeus was Persephone, Life. Her mother was
Demeter, the Earth. Hades seized Persephone and carried her to his
regions in the lower world where she became his wife. Then Earth became
disconsolate and could not be consoled. To assuage the grief of the
sorrowing mother Hades agreed to give her back to Earth for half the
year. While Life dwells with her mother, Earth, we have summer, and
flowers, and fruits, and joy. When Life returns to her husband, Hades,
winter and desolation return to Earth. Of this goddess <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb539" href="#pb539" name=
"pb539">539</a>]</span>Ridpath says: &ldquo;Persephone is close to Eve.
Eve means Life, and should have been so rendered, and would have been
but for the blundering of the English translators&rdquo; (History of
the World, Vol. II, p. 501).</p>
<p>The realm of Hades was called by his name. The term was borrowed by
the writers of the New Testament but has been translated
&ldquo;hell.&rdquo; Christians took possession of Hades&rsquo; kingdom;
but Hades was dethroned to make room for the Oriental Satan, and the
sad yet peaceful abode of departed spirits was transformed into a lake
of fire, the habitation of the damned.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Crete, who believed in the incarnation and death
of Zeus, guarded for centuries with zealous care what they alleged to
be the tomb of their god.</p>

<h3 class="main">Apollo.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This god, one of the principal solar deities, was the
son of Zeus. His mother was Leto. Like Mary, Leto had no hospitable
place for her accouchement, and brought her child forth on the barren
isle of Delos, where female divinities ministered to them. The isle was
illuminated by a flood of light, the prototype of a later scene where
&ldquo;the glory of the Lord shone round about&rdquo; the shepherds in
the field at Bethlehem; while sacred swans, like the celestial
visitants of Luke, made joyous gyrations in the air above them.</p>
<p>Apollo was the best beloved god of Greece, and was represented as
one of the most perfect types <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb540"
href="#pb540" name="pb540">540</a>]</span>of manly beauty. Like Christ
he led on earth a lowly life, following for a time the humble avocation
of a herdsman. Like Christ he came to reveal the will of his father. He
chose for his disciples a crew of sailors or fishermen. These, like the
disciples of Christ, were endowed with miraculous powers. Apollo was
regarded as a savior. He rescued the people from the deadly python,
which was desolating the land. Numerous festivals, similar to those
held in honor of Christ, were held in honor of Apollo.</p>
<p>In its article on this god McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Towards the later period of the
supremacy of paganism in the Roman Empire, Apollo, as the deity of the
sun, had assumed the chief place in heathen worship. As indicating that
Christ was the true &lsquo;light of the world,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Sun of
righteousness&rsquo;&mdash;the most favorite figure used in speaking of
the Savior in the early centuries&mdash;this very figure of Apollo was
often introduced as indicating Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leto, the mother of Apollo, was believed to be, like Mary, the
mother of Christ, a mortal raised to divinity. Her worship, like that
of Mary, was widespread and lasted for centuries.</p>

<p class="first">The Virgin myth, the Holy Ghost myth, and the Herodian

prophesied that he would be born of the virgin Danae, and that he would
supplant Acrisius in his kingdom. To <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

confined Danae in a tower. Here she was overshadowed by Zeus in
&ldquo;a shower of gold,&rdquo; and Perseus was born. To destroy him
Acrisius placed him with his mother in a chest and cast them into the
sea. They drifted to an island and the child was saved. He grew to
manhood, performed many wonderful works, vanquished his enemy and
ascended the throne.</p>

<h3 class="main">Hercules.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This god was the son of Zeus and the virgin Alcmeni.
His mother, like the mother of Jesus, retained her virginity after the
birth of her child. The Greek babe, like the Jewish babe, had an enemy.
Hera attempted to destroy the former, just as Herod afterward attempted
to destroy the latter. Like Christ he died a death of agony. When his
labors were finished, he closed his earthly career by mounting a
funeral pyre from which, surrounded by a dark cloud, amid thunder and
lightning, he ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>The Tyrian Hercules was worshiped by the Jews, and Jason, the Jewish
high-priest, sent a religious embassy with an offering of 300 drachms
of silver to this god.</p>
<p>Prof. Meinhold, of the University of Bonn, says: &ldquo;The
transfiguration and ascension of Christ may be compared to the heathen
apotheosis of such heroes as Hercules, while the story of the descent
into Hades is modeled after such narratives as those describing the
visit of Hercules and Theseus to the lower world.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb542" href="#pb542" name="pb542">542</a>]</span></p>
<p>Max Muller pronounces Hercules a solar god. His twelve labors, like
the twelve apostles of Christ, correspond to the twelve signs of the
Zodiac. Christians have admitted the resemblance of this god to Christ.
Parkhurst&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hebrew Lexicon&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The labors
of Hercules seem to have had a still higher view and to have been
originally designed as emblematical memorials of what the real son of
God and savior of the world was to do and suffer for our
sakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Heinrich Rower says: &ldquo;We are all acquainted with the
fact that in their mythological legends the Greeks and the Romans and
other nations of antiquity speak of certain persons as the sons of the
gods. An example of this is Hercules, the Greek hero, who is the son of
Jupiter, and an earthly mother. * * * All those men who performed
greater deeds than those which human beings usually do are regarded by
antiquity as of divine origin. This Greek and heathen notion has been
applied to the New Testament and churchly conception of the person of
Jesus. We must remember that at the time when Christianity sprang into
evidence, Greek culture and Greek religion spread over the whole world.
It is accordingly nothing remarkable that the Christians took from the
heathens the highest religious conceptions that they possessed, and
transferred them to Jesus. They accordingly called him the son of God,
and declared that he had been supernaturally born of a virgin. This is
the Greek and heathen influence which has determined the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb543" href="#pb543" name=

Luke concerning the birth of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Dionysos.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Zagreus was the son of Zeus. He was slain by the
Titans, buried at the foot of Mount Parnassus, and rose from the dead
as Dionysos. He was the god of fruit and wine. Like those of Christ his
most devoted followers were women. He is the beloved son and occupies a
throne at the right hand of his father, Zeus. His empty tomb at Delphi
was long preserved by his devotees as proof of his death and
resurrection.</p>
<p>The stories of the resurrection of Adonis in Phoenicia, of Osiris in
Egypt and of Dionysos in Greece were old when Christ was born, and
paved the way for the origin and acceptance of the story of his
resurrection.</p>
<p>Justin Martyr recognized the analogies between Christianity and
Paganism. Addressing the Pagans, he writes: &ldquo;When we say that the
Word, who is the first born of God, was produced without sexual union,
and that he, Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and
rose again, and ascended into heaven; we propound nothing different
from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter
(Zeus)&rdquo; (First Apology, ch. xxi).</p>
<p>Festivals, called Lenaea and the Greater Dionysia, corresponding in
a measure to the Christmas and Easter of Christians, were celebrated in
honor of this god. Prof. Gulick, professor of Greek in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb544" href="#pb544" name=
"pb544">544</a>]</span>Harvard University, describing these festivals,
says: &ldquo;In the winter came various celebrations in honor of
Dionysos, god of nature and the vine, the object of which was to wake
the sleeping spirit of generation and render him propitious for the
coming of spring and the sowing of crops * * * The wine-casks were
opened, and all, even slaves, were allowed perfect holiday and liberty
to drink in honor of the god. The last day of the festival was a sort
of All Souls&rsquo; Day, being devoted to the gods of the underworld
and the spirits of the dead&rdquo; (Life of the Ancient Greeks, pp.
274, 275). &ldquo;The Great Dionysia,&rdquo; says Prof. Gulick,
&ldquo;held in the spring, was the occasion of display and
magnificence&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 113).</p>
<p>So-called Christian burial is identical with Greek burial. Ancient
Greek sepulture is thus described by Ridpath: &ldquo;To the dead were
due the sacred rites of sepulture * * * When a Greek fell into his last
slumber, the friends immediately composed the body * * * The corse was
clad in white and laid upon a bier. Flowers were brought by the
mourning friends, who put on badges of sorrow * * * Cemeteries were
arranged outside the city walls * * * Over each [grave] was raised a
mound of earth, and on this were planted ivy and roses. * * * Over the
grave was erected a memorial stone or monument, and on this was an
inscription giving the name of the dead, an effigy perhaps of his
person, a word of praise for his virtues, and an epigram <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb545" href="#pb545" name=

<h3 class="main">Prometheus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Titan god, Prometheus, was the son of Iapetus and
Asia. He is one of the most sublime creations of the human imagination.
When Zeus, like Jehovah, became enraged at mankind and sought to
destroy it, Prometheus, like Christ, came on earth to intercede and
suffer for the race. Hurled to Tartarus by the thunderbolts of Zeus he
came again to endure, if need be, eternal agony for man.</p>
<p>For centuries Greeks and Romans believed the story of this vicarious
god to be historical. Grote, the historian, says: &ldquo;So long and so
firmly did this belief continue, that the Roman general Pompey, when in
command of an army in Kolchis, made with his companion, the literary
Greek Theophanes, a special march to view the spot in Caucasus where
Prometheus had been transfixed&rdquo; (Greek Mythology, pp. 92,
93).</p>
<p>Referring to the Greeks and their great tragedy, &ldquo;Prometheus
Bound,&rdquo; A. L. Rawson says: &ldquo;Its hero was their friend,
benefactor, creator, and savior, whose wrongs were incurred in their
behalf, and whose sorrows were endured for their salvation. He was
wounded for their transgressions, and bruised for their iniquities; the
chastisement of their peace was upon him, and by his stripes they were
healed&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

description of the crucifixion and the attending circumstances, even to
the earthquake and darkness, was thus anticipated by five
centuries&rdquo; (Bible: Whence and What?).</p>
<p>The dying Christ shares with the dying Prometheus the sympathies of
men. But how trivial the crucifixion, how light the suffering, and how
weak the courage of the Christian god appear compared with the cruel
crucifixion, the infinite suffering, and the deathless courage of the
immortal Pagan! Transfixed to the rock on Caucasus, the Golgotha of
Greek mythology, with the devouring eagle feeding forever on his
vitals, there falls from his lips no murmur of pain, no Sabachthani of
despair. What lofty heroism, what enduring patience, what unselfish
love, this tragic story has inspired!</p>

"pb547">547</a>]</span>curative powers. He healed all diseases, and
even restored the dead to life. He was called &ldquo;The Good
Physician.&rdquo; He was struck by a thunderbolt and ascended to
heaven. The Greeks worshiped him.</p>
<p>The miraculous cures ascribed to Christ, many of them, doubtless,
had their origin in the legends of Esculapius. Justin Martyr says:
&ldquo;In that we say he [Christ] made whole the lame, the paralytic,
and those born blind, we seem to say what is very similar to the deeds
said to have been done by Esculapius&rdquo; (First Apology, ch.
xxi).</p>

<h3 class="main">Plato.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the most gifted of mortals was Plato. His
followers believed him to be of divine descent. Concerning his
parentage, Dr. Draper says: &ldquo;Antiquity has often delighted to
cast a halo of mythical glory around its illustrious names. The
immortal works of this great philosopher seemed to entitle him to more
than mortal honors. A legend into the authenticity of which we will
abstain from inquiring, asserted that his mother, Perictione, a pure
virgin, suffered an immaculate conception through the influence of
Apollo. The god declared to Ariston, to whom she was about to be
married, the parentage of the child&rdquo; (Intellectual Development,
Vol. I, p. 151).</p>
<p>Concerning this myth, McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Legend, which is traced back to
Spensipus, the nephew of Plato, ascribed the paternity of Plato to the
god Apollo; and, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb548" href=
"#pb548" name="pb548">548</a>]</span>form in which the story is told by
Olympiodorus, closely imitates the record in regard to the nativity of
Christ&rdquo; (Art. Plato).</p>
<p>Immaculate conceptions were common in Greece. &ldquo;The furtive
pregnancy of young women, often by a god,&rdquo; says Grote, &ldquo;is
one of the most frequently recurring incidents in the legendary
narratives of the country.&rdquo; The Christian story of the miraculous
conception has not even the merit of originality. With the Platonic
legend before him, all that the Evangelist had to do was to substitute
Jehovah for Apollo, Joseph for Ariston, Mary for Perictione, and Jesus
for Plato.</p>
<p>The philosophy of Plato is a strange compound of profound wisdom
concerning the known and of vague speculations respecting the unknown.
The latter form no inconsiderable portion of the religion ascribed to
Christ. The Christian religion is supposed to be of Semitic origin; but
its doctrines are, many of them, the work of Greek theologians; its
incarnate God bears a Greek name, and its early literature was mostly
Greek. Draper recognizes three primitive modifications of Christianity:
1. Judaic Christianity; 2. Gnostic Christianity; 3. Platonic
Christianity. Platonic Christianity, he says, endured and is
essentially the Christianity of to-day.</p>
<p>The following are some of the principles of Plato&rsquo;s
philosophy:</p>
<p>There is but one God, and we ought to love and serve him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb549" href="#pb549" name=
"pb549">549</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Word formed the world and rendered it visible.</p>
<p>A knowledge of the Word will make us happy.</p>
<p>The soul is immortal, and the dead will rise again.</p>
<p>There will be a final judgment; the righteous will be rewarded, and
the wicked punished.</p>
<p>The design argument, the chief argument relied upon by Christians to
prove the divine origin of the universe, is a Platonic argument.</p>
<p>In a letter to the author twenty-five years ago, James Parton wrote:
&ldquo;Read carefully over the dialogue, Phaedo. You will see what you
will see: the whole Christian system and the entire dream of the
contemplative monk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phaedo deals chiefly with the soul&mdash;its nature and destiny. The
following quotations are from the translation of Henry Cary, M.A., of
Oxford:</p>
<p>Death is defined by Plato as &ldquo;the separation of the soul from
the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Can the soul, which is invisible,
and which goes to another place like itself, excellent, pure, and
invisible, and therefore truly called the invisible world, to the
presence of a good and wise God, (whither if God will, my soul also
must shortly go), can this soul of ours, I ask, being such and of such
a nature, when separated from the body, be immediately dispersed and
destroyed, as most men assert? Far from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If that which is immortal is
imperishable, it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb550" href="#pb550"
name="pb550">550</a>]</span>impossible for the soul to perish, when
death approaches it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When, therefore, death approaches
a man, the mortal part of him, as it appears, dies, but the immortal
part departs safe and uncorrupted, having withdrawn itself from
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After death, Plato says, the souls are conducted to a place where
they &ldquo;receive sentence and then proceed to Hades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the soul &ldquo;arrives at the place where the others are,
impure, ... every one shuns it, and will neither be its fellow traveler
or guide, but it wanders about oppressed with every kind of
helplessness.... But the soul which has passed through life with purity
and moderation, having obtained the gods for its fellow travelers and
guides, settles each in the place suited to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If the soul is immortal, it
requires our care not only for the present time, which we call life,
but for all time; and the danger would now appear to be dreadful, if
one should neglect it. For if death were a deliverance from everything,
it would be a great gain for the wicked, when they die, to be delivered
at the same time from the body, and from their vices together with the
soul; but now, since it appears to be immortal, it can have no other
refuge from evils, nor safety, except by becoming as good and wise as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ, it is claimed, &ldquo;brought immortality to light.&rdquo;
Yet Phaedo was written nearly four centuries before Christ came.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb551" href="#pb551" name=
"pb551">551</a>]</span></p>
<p>McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cyclopedia&rdquo; concedes
Plato&rsquo;s &ldquo;near approximation to the doctrines of
Christianity&mdash;some of which,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;he announces
almost in the language of the Apostles.&rdquo; Continuing, this
authority says: &ldquo;We know no more terrible and sublime picture
than the passage in which he depicts the dead presenting themselves for
judgment in the other world, scarred and blotched and branded with the
ineradicable marks of their earthly sins. Yet this is but one of many
analogous passages. This approximation to revealed truth is among the
most insoluble problems bequeathed to us by antiquity.... We offer no
solution of the enigma, which awaits its Oedipus. We only note the
existence of the riddle&rdquo; (Plato).</p>
<p>Prof. Gunkel, of Berlin, says: &ldquo;&lsquo;Christianity is a
syncretistic religion. It is providential that it passed safely over
from the Orient into the Greek world. It imbibed both influences, and
acquired many features that were foreign to the original
gospel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Closely allied to the Essenes and the primitive Christians is
another Pythagorian sect, known as the Therapeuts of Egypt. Regarding
this sect, four different theories are held: 1. That they were a Jewish
sect. 2. That they were a Jewish Christian sect. 3. That they were
Pagans, many of whose teachings were incorporated into the Christian
creed. 4. That they are a myth, that the &ldquo;De Vita
Contemplativa&rdquo; of Philo, which contains the only account of them,
is a Christian forgery, written for the purpose of extolling the
monastic life, the celibacy, and the asceticism of the church.</p>

<h3 class="main">Bacchus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bacchus was a Roman god, or rather a Roman
modification of the Greek god, Dionysos. He was the god of wine. He
cultivated the vine, made wine, and encouraged its use. His worship
extended over nearly the whole of the ancient world. It consisted
largely of protracted festivals, where wine flowed freely, and joyous
and noisy ceremonies were indulged in.</p>
<p>This god and his worship have survived in Christ and Christianity.
Christ was called a &ldquo;winebibber&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%207:34">Luke vii,
34</a>); he made wine&mdash;his first miracle was the conversion of
water into wine (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%202:1-10">John ii,
1&ndash;10</a>); he blessed the winecup, and commanded his disciples to
drink in remembrance of him (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2022:17">Luke xxii,
17</a>), just as the devotees of Bacchus drank in remembrance of their
god. Christianity, more than all other religions combined, has
contributed to keep alive the Bacchanalian feasts and revelries.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb554" href="#pb554" name=
"pb554">554</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bacchus,&rdquo; says Volney,
&ldquo;in the history of his whole life, and even of his death, brings
to mind the history of the god of Christians&rdquo; (Ruins, p. 169).
The cabalistic names of Bacchus and Jesus, Volney says, were the
same.</p>
<p>United with the worship of Bacchus, and similar to it, was the
worship of the goddess Ceres (Demeter). Her rites were known as the
Eleusinian mysteries. Cakes were eaten in her honor. And thus in the
bread of Ceres and the wine of Bacchus we have the bread and wine of
the Christian Eucharist. &ldquo;It is well known,&rdquo; says Dr.
Westbrook, &ldquo;that the Athenians celebrated the allegorical giving
of the flesh to eat of Ceres, the goddess of corn, and in like manner
the giving his blood to drink by Bacchus, the god of wine.&rdquo; This
worship, like the Mithraic worship, which also included the communion,
had its origin in the East, and was one of the first, as well as one of
the last, of the religions of ancient Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Another rite connected with the mysteries was the use of holy water.
Lempriere, in his &ldquo;Classical Dictionary,&rdquo; describing the
Eleusinian mysteries as they existed in Greece centuries before the
Christian era, says: &ldquo;As the candidates for initiation entered
the temple, they purified themselves by washing their hands in holy
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mysteries comprehended the origin of life, and nature worship
was included in the ceremonies. At the festivals women carried the
phallus in their processions. Regarding the worship of Bacchus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb555" href="#pb555" name=
"pb555">555</a>]</span>and Ceres at Rome, &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;
Encyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;These rites degenerated, and came to
be celebrated with a licentiousness that threatened the destruction of
morality and of society itself. They were made the occasion of the most
unnatural excesses. At first, only women took part in these mysterious
Bacchic rites, but latterly men also were admitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Roman government suppressed the later Bacchanalian and
Eleusinian feasts, together with the Christian Agapae, because of their
debaucheries, obscenities, and supposed infant sacrifices. Meredith, in
&ldquo;The Prophet of Nazareth&rdquo; (pp. 225&ndash;231), institutes
an examination to ascertain &ldquo;how far the Eleusinian and
Bacchanalian feasts resembled the Christian Agapae.&rdquo; His
conclusion is that the facts &ldquo;show clearly that the Christian
Agapae were of pagan origin&mdash;were identically the same as the
pagan feasts.&rdquo; Gibbon says: &ldquo;The language of that great
historian [Tacitus, in his allusion to Christians] is almost similar to
the style employed by Livy, when he relates the introduction and the
suppression of the rites of Bacchus&rdquo; (Rome, vol. 1, P. 579).</p>
<p>Referring to the Agapae, Dr. Cave says it was commonly charged that
Christians &ldquo;exercised lust and filthiness under a pretense of
religion, promiscuously calling themselves brothers and sisters, that
by the help of so sacred a name their common adulteries might become
incestuous&rdquo; (Primitive Christianity, Part II, chap. v).
Describing the Carpocratians, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb556"
href="#pb556" name="pb556">556</a>]</span>an early Christian sect, Dr.
Cave says: &ldquo;Both men and women used to meet at supper (which was
called their love-feast), when after they had loaded themselves with a
plentiful meal, to prevent all shame, if they had any remaining, they
put out the lights, and then promiscuously mixed in filthiness with one
another&rdquo; (Ibid).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;International Cyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;With the
increase of wealth and the decay of religious earnestness and purity in
the Christian church, the Agapae became occasions of great riotousness
and debaucheries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Agapae, with their excesses eliminated, survive in the
love-feasts of modern Christians. Webster defines
&ldquo;love-feast&rdquo; as &ldquo;a religious festival, held quarterly
by the Methodists, in imitation of the Agapae of the early
Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That these mysteries of Bacchus and Ceres were adopted by the early
Christians is largely admitted by the great church historian himself.
Writing of the second century, Mosheim says: &ldquo;The profound
respect paid to the Greek and Roman mysteries, and the extraordinary
sanctity that was attributed to them, was a further circumstance that
induced the Christians to give their religion a mystic air, in order to
put it upon an equal foot, in point of dignity, with that of the
Pagans. For this purpose they gave the name of &lsquo;mysteries&rsquo;
to the institutions of the gospel, and decorated particularly the holy
Sacrament with that solemn title. They used in that sacred institution,
as also in that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb557" href="#pb557"
name="pb557">557</a>]</span>of baptism, several of the terms employed
in the heathen mysteries and proceeded so far at length as even to
adopt some of the rites and ceremonies of which these renowned
mysteries consisted.&rdquo; (Ecclesiastical History, p. 56.)</p>
<p>England&rsquo;s highest authority on early Christian history, Dean
Milman, says: &ldquo;Christianity disdained that its God and its
Redeemer should be less magnificently honored than the demons (gods) of
Paganism. In the service it delighted to breathe, as it were, a
sublimer sense into the common appellations of the Pagan worship,
whether from the ordinary ceremonial or the more secret mysteries. The
church became a temple; the table of the communion an altar; the
celebration of the Eucharist, the appalling, or unbloody sacrifice....
The incense, the garlands, the lamps, all were gradually adopted by
zealous rivalry, or seized as the lawful spoils of vanquished Paganism
and consecrated to the service of Christ.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The church rivaled the old heathen
mysteries in expanding by slow degrees its higher privileges.... Its
preparatory ceremonial of abstinence, personal purity, ablution,
secrecy, closely resembled that of the Pagan mysteries (perhaps each
may have contributed to the other)&rdquo; (History of Christianity,
Vol. III, pp. 312, 313).</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dictionary of Antiquities&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;The mysteries occupied a place among the ancients analogous to
that of the holy sacraments in the Christian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb558" href="#pb558" name=
"pb558">558</a>]</span>church.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Encyclopedia
Britannica&rdquo; makes the same statement.</p>
<p>James Anthony Froude, in a letter to Prof. Johnson, of England,
says: &ldquo;I have long been convinced that the Christian Eucharist is
but a continuation of the Eleusinian mysteries. St. Paul, in using the
word <i>teleiois</i>, almost confirms this.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Saturn.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the oldest and most renowned of the European
gods was Saturn, whose name was given by the ancients to one of the
planets and to one of the days of the week. He was worshiped by the
inhabitants of Italy more than a thousand years before Christ came, and
centuries before Rome took her place among the nations of the earth.
His temples were located in various parts of Italy, the latest and the
principal one being at Rome. His chief festival, and the greatest of
all the Roman festivals, was the Saturnalia celebrated at the time of
the winter solstice. This festival survives in the Christian festival
of Christmas.</p>
<p>The following description of the Saturnalia is from the pen of
Ridpath: &ldquo;The most elaborate of all the celebrations of Rome was
that of Saturn, held at the winter solstice, and afterwards extended so
as to include the twenty-fifth of December.... The festival was called
the Saturnalia. Labor ceased, public business was at an end, the courts
were closed, the schools had holiday. Tables, laden with bounties, were
spread on every hand, and at these all classes for the nonce sat down
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb559" href="#pb559" name=
"pb559">559</a>]</span>together. The master and the slave for the day
were equals. It was a time of gift-giving and innocent abandonment. In
the public shops every variety of the present, from the simplest to the
most costly, could be found. Fathers, mothers, kinspeople, friends, all
hurried thither to purchase, according to their fancy, what things
soever seemed most tasteful and appropriate as presents&rdquo; (History
of the World, Vol. III, p. 97).</p>
<p>Concerning this festival the &ldquo;Encyclopedia Britannica&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;All classes exchanged gifts, the commonest being wax
tapers and clay dolls. These dolls were especially given to children,
and the makers of them held a regular fair at this time.&rdquo; One of
the principal rites, the &ldquo;Britannica&rdquo; says, was the burning
of many candles. &ldquo;The modern Italian carnival,&rdquo; says
&ldquo;Chambers&rsquo; Encyclopedia,&rdquo; &ldquo;would seem to be
only the old pagan Saturnalia baptized into Christianity.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Quirinus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nearly every reader is familiar with the story of the
founding of Rome. Rhea Silvia, a vestal virgin, bears twins by the god
Mars. As they are heirs to the throne which Amulius has usurped, he
attempts to destroy them by drowning. They are miraculously preserved
and finally rescued by a shepherd. One of them, Romulus, becomes the
founder and king of Rome. After a reign of 37 years he is translated by
his father, and eventually becomes the tutelary god of the Romans,
under the name of Quirinus. The following account of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb560" href="#pb560" name="pb560">560</a>]</span>his
translation is from &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo; Encyclopedia&rdquo;:
&ldquo;While he was standing near the &lsquo;Goat&rsquo;s Pool&rsquo;
in the Campus Martius, reviewing his militia, the sun was eclipsed, and
a dark storm swept over the plain and hills. When it had passed, the
people looked round for their king, but he was gone. His father, Mars,
had carried him up to heaven (like the prophet Elijah) in a chariot of
fire. Some time after he reappeared in a glorified form to Proculus
Julius, announced the future greatness of the Roman people, and told
him that henceforth he would watch over them as their guardian god,
under the name of Quirinus&rdquo; (Art. Romulus).</p>
<p>Next to the Saturnalia, the most important religious festival of
Pagan Rome was the Quirinalia, which celebrated the ascension of
Quirinus. It corresponds to Ascension Day, one of the principal
religious festivals of the Christian church, which celebrates the
ascension of Christ.</p>
<p>The supernatural darkness of the Roman myth, it is believed,
suggested the supernatural darkness of the crucifixion myth. The
reappearance of Quirinus in a glorified form is also believed by some
to have suggested the transfiguration.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Odin, the All-Father, held the highest rank in the
Northern pantheon. He was the son of Boer and Bestla. Freya was his
queen. His religion prevailed among the Scandinavians and among the
Goths, the Saxons, and other ancient German tribes. Some believe that
he was an ancient hero who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb561" href=
"#pb561" name="pb561">561</a>]</span>with a horde of Goths or Scythians
conquered the North a thousand years or more before the Christian era.
The prevailing opinion, however, is that the Norse mythology had its
birth in Asia&mdash;in India, Persia, or Accadia&mdash;and was carried
by the Aryans to northern Europe, where it underwent many
modifications.</p>
<p>This mythology recognized as existing in the beginning, two
worlds&mdash;one the warm South, the other the icy North. The entrance
to the Southland was guarded by a flaming sword. Between heat and cold,
as between good and evil, there was perpetual strife. From heat Ymir
(Chaos), the father of giants, was evolved. Odin and his brothers slew
Ymir and from his body created the earth, his flesh forming the land,
his blood the sea. Out of two trees Odin made man and woman, and
breathed into them the breath of life. For the abode of man a fruitful
garden was planted in the center of the earth and called Midgard.
Beneath the earth dwells Hel, the goddess of the dead.</p>
<p>Loki is the god of evil. He will be chained for a time and then
released. A bloody war will follow. On one side, led by Loki, will
fight the hosts of Hel; on the other Odin and his followers. Loki will
triumph for a while, mankind will be destroyed, and heaven and earth
will be consumed by fire. But Odin will be victorious in the end. He
will create a new heaven and a new earth. He will be the ruler of all
things, and will dwell in heaven, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb562"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thor was the son of Odin and the virgin Earth. He was
called the first born son of God. His worship was more widespread than
that of any other Northern god. In the temple at Upsala he occupied the
same place in the Scandinavian Trinity that Christ does in the
Christian Trinity. Like Christ he died for man and was worshiped as a
Savior. Midgard had a serpent, more formidable if not more wily than
that of Eden, which threatened to destroy the human race. Thor attacked
and slew the monster, but was himself killed by the venom which was
exhaled from it. The slaying of the serpent of Midgard by Thor, the
slaying of the python by the Greek god, and the bruising of the head of
the serpent of Hebrew mythology by Christ, are analogous myths.</p>
<p>Thor dwells in a mansion in the clouds. The thunder we hear in the
sky is the noise of his chariot wheels, and the flashes of lightning
are from his hammer which he dashes against the mountains. The
&ldquo;Britannica&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Some of the monks of a later
period endeavored to persuade the Northmen that in Thor their
forefathers had worshiped Christ, the strong and mighty Savior of the
oppressed, and that his mallet was the rude <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb563" href="#pb563" name="pb563">563</a>]</span>form
of the cross.&rdquo; &ldquo;The sign of the hammer,&rdquo; says
&ldquo;Chambers,&rdquo; &ldquo;was analogous to that of the cross among
Christians.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Baldur.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the purest, one of the gentlest, and one of the
best beloved of all the gods was Baldur, the beautiful son of Odin and
Freya. In him were combined all things good and noble. The envious
gods, inspired by Loki, shot their arrows at him in vain until the
blind god Hoder pierced his body with an arrow of mistletoe and he
passed into the power of Hel, the pallid goddess of death.
Sometime&mdash;when the old order of things has passed away&mdash;in
another and better world, where envy, and hatred, and war are unknown,
Baldur will live again.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The death of Baldur,&rdquo; says
Prof. Rasmus B. Anderson, the highest authority on Norse mythology,
&ldquo;forms the turning point in the great drama.... While he lived
the power of the asas (gods) was secure, but when Baldur, at the
instigation of Loki, was slain, the fall of creation could not be
prevented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing of Norse mythology, Andrew Lang says: &ldquo;There is,
almost undoubtedly, a touch of Christian dawn on the figure and myth of
the pure and beloved and ill-fated god Baldur, and his descent into
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Odin, and Thor, and Baldur, and their divine companions are
worshiped no longer; but their religion has left a deep impress on the
religion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb564" href="#pb564" name=
"pb564">564</a>]</span>that supplanted it. The Christianity of
Scandinavia, of northern Germany, of England, and of America, the whole
of Protestant Christianity, in short, and to some extent Catholicism
itself, has been modified by this strange and fascinating faith.
Regarding this subject &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo; Encyclopedia&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;So deep-rooted was the adhesion to the faith of Odin in the
North, that the early Christian teachers, unable to eradicate the old
ideas, were driven to the expedient of trying to give them a coloring
of Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The selection of December 25th as the date of the Nativity was
doubtless suggested by the Mithraic or some other solar worship of the
East, but the Protestant Christmas came from the North. The mistletoe
with which Baldur was slain reappears in this festival. The fire wheel,
a remnant of the old Norse sun worship, existed among German Christians
until the nineteenth century. The burning of the Yule log still
survives. In some provinces of Germany the festival is still called by
its Pagan name.</p>
<p>Rev. Samuel M. Jackson, D.D., LL.D., Professor of Church History,
New York University, says: &ldquo;The Romans had, like other Pagan
nations, a nature festival, called by them Saturnalia, and the Northern
peoples had Yule; both celebrated the turn of the year from the death
of winter to the life of spring&mdash;the winter solstice. As this was
an auspicious change the festival was a very joyous one.... The giving
of presents and the burning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb565" href=
"#pb565" name="pb565">565</a>]</span>of candles characterized it. Among
the northern people the lighting of a huge log in the houses of the
great and with appropriate ceremonies was a feature. The Roman church
finding this festival deeply intrenched in popular esteem, wisely
adopted it&rdquo; (Universal Cyclopedia).</p>
<p>The festival of Easter belongs to this religion. It was observed in
honor of the Saxon goddess Eastre, or Ostara, the goddess of Spring. It
celebrated, not the resurrection of Christ, but the resurrection of
Spring and flowers. It still retains the name of this goddess. Nearly
every festival of the church&mdash;and the Catholic and English
churches have many&mdash;are of Pagan origin. Every day of the week
bears a Pagan name&mdash;four of them the names of Scandinavian
gods&mdash;Tuesday the name of Tiu (Tyr), Wednesday the name of Woden
(Odin), Thursday the name of Thor, and Friday that of Freya. Even the
Christian &ldquo;hell&rdquo; was derived from &ldquo;Hel,&rdquo; the
name of the Norse goddess of the lower world. <span class=

<p>The Old Testament consists largely of borrowed myths. Nearly
everything in Genesis, and much of the so-called history which follows,
are but a recital of Assyrian, Babylonian, Chaldean and other legends.
Dr. Draper says: &ldquo;From such Assyrian sources, the legends of the
creation of the earth and heaven, the garden of Eden, the making of man
from clay, and of woman from one of his ribs, the temptation by the
serpent, the naming of animals, the cherubim and flaming sword, the
Deluge and the ark, the drying up of the waters by the wind, the
building of the Tower of Babel, and the confusion of tongues, were
obtained by Ezra&rdquo; (Conflict, p. 223).</p>
<p>The ten antediluvian patriarchs, Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan,
Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah, whom Luke
presents as the first ten progenitors of Christ, are now known to have
been a dynasty of Babylonian kings. Abram, Isaac, Jacob, and Judah,
whom both Matthew and Luke declare to have been ancestors of Christ,
and whom Matthew places at the head of his genealogy, were not persons
at all, but merely tribes of people. In regard to this Rev. Dr. Oort,
professor of Oriental languages <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb570"
href="#pb570" name="pb570">570</a>]</span>at Amsterdam, says:
&ldquo;They do not signify men, so much as groups of nations or single
tribes. Abram, for instance, represents a great part of the Terachites;
Lot, the Moabites and Ammonites, whose ancestor he is called; Ishmael,
certain tribes of Arabia; Isaac, Israel and Edom together; Jacob,
Israel alone; while his twelve sons stand for the twelve tribes of
Israel. * * * Here and there the writers of the old legend themselves
point out, as it were, that the patriarchs whom they bring upon the
scene as men are personifications of tribes&rdquo; (Bible for Learners,
Vol. I, pp. 100&ndash;102). Moses, the reputed founder of Judaism and
archetype of Christ, doubtless existed; but nearly all the Bible
stories concerning him are myths. David and Solomon, from whose house
Christ is said to have been descended, are historical characters; but
the accounts respecting the greatness of their kingdom and the splendor
of their reigns are fabulous.</p>
<p>Christ and Christianity are partly creations and partly evolutions.
While the elements composing them were mostly derived from preexisting
and contemporary beliefs, they were not formed as a novelist creates a
hero and a convention frames a constitution. Their growth was gradual.
Jesus, if he existed, was a Jew, and his religion, with a few
innovations, was Judaism. With his death, probably, his apotheosis
began. During the first century the transformation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb571" href="#pb571" name="pb571">571</a>]</span>was
slow; but during the succeeding centuries rapid. The Judaic elements of
his religion were, in time, nearly all eliminated, and the Pagan
elements, one by one, were incorporated into the new faith.</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of this religion Lecky says:
&ldquo;Christianity had become the central intellectual power of the
world, but it triumphed not so much by superseding rival faiths as by
absorbing and transforming them. Old systems, old rites, old images
were grafted into the new belief, retaining much of their ancient
character but assuming new names and a new complexion&rdquo;
(Rationalism, Vol. I. p. 223).</p>
<p>Its origin is thus traced by Mrs. Besant: &ldquo;From the later Jews
comes the Unity of God; from India and Egypt the Trinity in Unity; from
India and Egypt the crucified Redeemer; from India, Egypt, Greece, and
Rome, the virgin mother and the divine son; from Egypt its priests and
its ritual; from the Essenes and the Therapeuts its asceticism; from
Persia, India, and Egypt, its sacraments; from Persia and Babylonia its
angels and devils; from Alexandria the blending into one of many lines
of thought.&rdquo; (Freethinkers&rsquo; Text Book, p. 392.)</p>
<p>Concerning this, Judge Strange, another English writer, says:
&ldquo;The Jewish Scriptures and the traditionary teachings of their
doctors, the Essenes and Therapeuts, the Greek philosophers, the
Neo-Platonism of Alexandria and the Buddhism <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb572" href="#pb572" name="pb572">572</a>]</span>of
the East, gave ample supplies for the composition of the doctrinal
portion of the new faith; the divinely procreated personages of the
Grecian and Roman pantheons, the tales of the Egyptian Osiris, and of
the Indian Rama, Krishna, and Buddha, furnished the materials for the
image of the new Savior of mankind.&rdquo; (Portraiture and Mission of
Jesus, p. 27.)</p>
<p>Dr. G. W. Brown, previously quoted, says: &ldquo;The Eclectics
formed the nucleus into which were merged all the various religions of
the Orient. Mithra, of the Zoroastrians; Krishna and Buddha, of the
Brahmans; Osiris, of the Egyptians, and Bacchus, of the Greeks and
Romans, all disappeared and were lost in the new God Jesus, each of the
predecessors contributing to the conglomerate religion known as
Christian, Buddha and probably Bacchus contributing the
most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. John W. Draper, recognized on both sides of the Atlantic as one
of the most erudite, one of the most philosophic, and one of the most
impartial of historians, in the following paragraphs tells the story of
the rise and triumph of this <span class="corr" id="xd21e14890" title=
"Source: everchanging">ever-changing</span> faith:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In a political sense, Christianity
is the bequest of the Roman Empire to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Not only as a token of the
conquest she had made, but also as a gratification to her pride, the
conquering republic brought the gods of the vanquished peoples to Rome.
With disdainful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb573" href="#pb573"
name="pb573">573</a>]</span>toleration, she permitted the worship of
them all. That paramount authority exercised by each divinity in his
original seat disappeared at once in the crowd of gods and goddesses
among whom he had been brought. Already, as we have seen, through
geographical discoveries and philosophical criticism, faith in the
religion of the old days had been profoundly shaken. It was, by this
policy of Rome, brought to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In one of the Eastern provinces,
Syria, some persons in very humble life had associated themselves
together for benevolent and religious purposes. The doctrines they held
were in harmony with that sentiment of universal brotherhood arising
from the coalescence of the conquered kingdoms. They were doctrines
inculcated by Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;From this germ was developed a
new, and as the events proved, all-powerful society&mdash;the Church;
new, for nothing of the kind had existed in antiquity; powerful, for
the local churches, at first isolated, soon began to confederate for
their common interest. Through this organization Christianity achieved
all her political triumphs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;After the abdication of Diocletian
(A. D., 305), Constantine, one of the competitors for the purple,
perceiving the advantages that would accrue to him from such a policy,
put himself forth as the head of the Christian party. This gave him, in
every part of the empire, men and women ready to encounter fire and
sword in his behalf; it gave him unwavering adherents in every legion
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb574" href="#pb574" name=
"pb574">574</a>]</span>of the armies. In a decisive battle, near the
Milvian bridge, victory crowned his schemes. The death of Maximian, and
subsequently that of Licinius, removed all obstacles. He ascended the
throne of the Caesars&mdash;the first Christian emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Place, profit, power&mdash;these
were in view of whoever now joined the conquering sect. Crowds of
worldly persons, who cared nothing about its religious ideas, became
its warmest supporters. Pagans at heart, their influence was soon
manifested in the paganization of Christianity that forthwith
ensued.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As years passed on, the faith
described by Tertullian was transmuted into one more fashionable and
more debased. It was incorporated with the old Greek mythology. Olympus
was restored, but the divinities passed under other names. The more
powerful provinces insisted on the adoption of their time-honored
conceptions. Views of the Trinity, in accordance with Egyptian
traditions, were established.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Heathen rites were adopted, a
pompous and splendid ritual, gorgeous robes, mitres, tiaras,
wax-tapers, processional services, lustrations, gold and silver vases,
were introduced. The Roman lituns, the chief ensign of the augurs,
became the crozier. Churches were built over the tombs of martyrs, and
consecrated with rites borrowed from the ancient laws of the Roman
pontiffs. Festivals and commemorations of martyrs <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb575" href="#pb575" name=
"pb575">575</a>]</span>multiplied with the numberless fictitious
discoveries of their remains. Fasting became the grand means of
repelling the devil and appeasing God; celibacy the greatest of the
virtues. Pilgrimages were made to Palestine and the tombs of the
martyrs. Quantities of dust and earth were brought from the Holy Land
and sold at enormous prices, as antidotes against devils. The virtues
of consecrated water were upheld. Images and relics were introduced
into the churches, and worshiped after the fashion of the heathen
gods.... The apotheosis of the old Roman times was replaced by
canonization; tutelary saints succeeded to local mythological
divinities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As centuries passed, the
paganization became more and more complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The maxim holds good in the social
as well as the mechanical world, that, when two bodies strike, the form
of both is changed. Paganism was modified by Christianity; Christianity
by Paganism&rdquo; (Conflict, pp. 34&ndash;52).</p>
<p>While affirming the divine origin of Christianity, the church
historian Mosheim admits its early paganization. He says: &ldquo;The
rites and institutions, by which the Greeks, Romans, and other nations
had formerly testified their religious veneration for fictitious
deities, were now adopted, with some slight alterations, by Christian
bishops, and employed in the service of the true God.... Hence it
happened that in these times the religion of the Greeks and Romans
differed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb576" href="#pb576" name=
"pb576">576</a>]</span>very little in its external appearance from that
of the Christians. They had both a most pompous and splendid ritual.
Gorgeous robes, mitres, tiaras, wax-tapers, crosiers, processions,
lustrations, images, gold and silver vases, and many such circumstances
of pageantry, were equally to be seen in the heathen temples and the
Christian churches&rdquo; (Ecclesiastical History, p. 105).</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton, in an article which appeared in the
North American Review, says: &ldquo;There is, in fact, as we now see,
nothing in the externals of the Christian church which is not a
survival from the churches of paganism.... The sacramental use of water
and bread and wine, the very sign of the cross&mdash;all are ancient
human institutions, rites and symbols. Scratch a Christian and you come
upon a Pagan. Christianity is a rebaptized paganism.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Christendom,&rdquo; says Dr. Lyman Abbott, &ldquo;is only an
imperfectly Christianized paganism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The creeds of old are dead or dying, and the celestial kings, who
seemed so real to their worshipers, are mostly crownless phantoms now.
Buddha, <span class="corr" id="xd21e14928" title=
"Source: Laoutsze">Laou-tsze</span>, and Confucius, the wise men of the
East, command the reverence of nearly half the world, and the Persian
prophet has a few followers; but from these faiths the supernatural is
vanishing. Millions yet believe that Krishna, the Christ of India, is
the son of God; but this faith, too, is waning. The intellectual
offspring of Plato&rsquo;s brilliant brain survive, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb577" href="#pb577" name="pb577">577</a>]</span>all
that remains of his divine father is a mutilated effigy. The genial Sun
still warms and lights the earth, but centuries have flown since
Mithra, his beloved, received the adoration of mankind. The fire still
glows upon the hearth, but the great Titan who brought it down from
Heaven lives only in a poet&rsquo;s dream. The crimson nectar of the
vine moves men to mirth and madness now as when the swan of Teos sang
its praise, but Bacchus and the ancient mysteries are dead. Above
storm-wrapped Olympus, as of old, is heard the thunder&rsquo;s awful
peal, but it is not the voice of Zeus. The voice of this, the mightiest
of all the gods, is hushed forever. The populous and ever-growing
empire of the dead still flourishes, but in its solemn court Osiris no
longer sits as judge. The mother, as of yore, presses to her loving
heart her dimpled babe and fondly gazes into its azure eyes to woo its
artless smile; but Egypt&rsquo;s star-crowned virgin and her royal
child, who once received the homage of a world, are now but mythic
dust. Manly beauty thrills our daughters&rsquo; hearts with
love&rsquo;s strange ecstasy, and the feigned suffering of the dying
hero on the mimic stage moistens their eyes with tears; but Adonis
sleeps in his Phoenician tomb, his slumbers undisturbed by
woman&rsquo;s sobs. The purple flower, substance of his dear self,
which Venus carried in her bosom, withered long ago. When, at eve, the
summer shower bathes with its cooling drops the verdure of the fields,
across the sun-kissed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb578" href=
"#pb578" name="pb578">578</a>]</span>cloud which veils the Orient sky
may still be seen the gorgeous bridge of Bifrost; but over its majestic
arch the dauntless Odin rides no more.</p>

<p>What has been the fate of the Pagan gods will be the fate of the
Christian deity. Christianity, which supplanted the ancient faiths,
will, in turn, be supplanted by other religions. On two continents
already the cross has gone down before the crescent. The belief in
Christ as a divine being is passing away. The creeds, as of old, affirm
his divinity, but in the minds of his more enlightened followers the
divine elements are disappearing. What was formerly believed to be
supernatural is now known to be natural. What were once living verities
are now dead formalities. Slowly and painfully, but surely and clearly,
men are becoming convinced that there are no divine beings and no
supernatural religions&mdash;that all the gods, including Christ, are
myths, and all the religions, including Christianity, human
productions. In the words of Jules Soury, &ldquo;Time, which condenses
nebulae, lights up suns, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb579" href=
"#pb579" name="pb579">579</a>]</span>brings life and thought upon
planets theretofore steeped in death, and gives back ephemeral worlds
to dissolution and the fertile chaos of the everlasting
universe&mdash;time knows nought of gods nor of the dim and fallacious
hopes of ignorant mortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these sublime pictures&mdash;a retrospect and a
prophecy&mdash;from the gallery of the great master, I close this
long-drawn subject:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When India is supreme, Brahma sits
upon the world&rsquo;s throne. When the sceptre passes to Egypt, Isis
and Osiris receive the homage of mankind. Greece, with her fierce
valor, sweeps to empire, and Zeus puts on the purple of authority. The
earth trembles with the tread of Rome&rsquo;s intrepid sons, and Jove
grasps with mailed hand the thunderbolts of Heaven. Rome falls, and
Christians, from her territory, with the red sword of war, carve out
the ruling nations of the world, and now Christ sits upon the old
throne. Who will be his successor?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I look again. The popes and
priests are gone. The altars and the thrones have mingled with the
dust. The aristocracy of land and cloud have perished from the earth
and air. The gods are dead. A new religion sheds its glory on
mankind.... And as I look Life lengthens, Joy deepens, Love
intensifies, Fear dies&mdash;Liberty at last is God, and Heaven is
here.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb581" href="#pb581" name=
